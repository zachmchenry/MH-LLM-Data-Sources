Reasoning: 1. The post expresses frustration towards a subreddit (the ""sub"" mentioned in the post) and criticizes its existence, implying a belief that the subreddit does not provide appropriate help or support. This suggests that the individual may not perceive themselves as a burden to others, as they are focusing on the inadequacy of the support they believe others are receiving.

2. The post mentions that the individual has gone through a difficult phase in their life and has received professional help from a psychologist. This indicates that they have sought and received assistance for their own mental well-being, which suggests a level of self-awareness and proactivity in managing their mental health.

3. While the post expresses concern for others potentially needing professional help and references various possible causes of mental distress, it does not provide personal reflections or feelings of being a burden or better off gone. Instead, the post encourages others to seek professional help, indicating a belief in the efficacy of such interventions rather than a desire to withdraw from others.

Based on these reasons, the post does not show a risk of perceived burdensomeness."

"Consider this post: ""2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away, not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff.

I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step, being medication, has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure.

Then I managed to meet a girl at my new job and I fell in love with her. Everything about her was perfect for me and I felt like we bonded really well, except for the fact that she had a boyfriend. She was unhappy with her relationship and I hoped to help her get out of a toxic relationship and make her my own. Today she friendzoned me and said she's staying with her boyfriend, and now I'm completely alone all over again with no friends and nobody I care enough about to live for. Sure, my family might care for a couple weeks but after that I would be forgotten forever if I was gone. I have no motivation to go and make new friends and I feel like if I talk to any new girls I'm just going to think about this first girl and want her back. I just want to end it all and never have to deal with this complete feeling of loneliness ever again."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling completely alone and having nobody to live for. These thoughts indicate a sense of isolation and a lack of social support, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post expresses dissatisfaction with the current social situation, such as losing contact with friends and experiencing unrequited love. These experiences of social distress can contribute to feelings of burdensomeness.
3. The post mentions a lack of motivation to make new friends and a fear of being reminded of the first girl. This suggests a possible desire to escape from the perceived burdensomeness through self-harm or suicide."
"Consider this post: ""My life isn't getting better, albeit I'm very young I really just dream of a point in the future that things are just working out in my favor for once. I hear about people hitting their rock bottoms and finally making a change that leads them to a much better version of themselves. I imagine myself progressively doing worse and worse things until I reach my rock bottom. That scares me because I have been doing worse and worse things and I don't want to hit that rock bottom anytime soon, I just want to change."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: In this post, the individual expresses a desire for their life to improve and a fear of hitting rock bottom, but does not directly mention feelings of loneliness or disconnectedness. While the mention of wanting things to work out in their favor and wanting to change could suggest dissatisfaction with their current state, it does not provide clear evidence of a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness."

These thoughts suggest a desire for change and a fear of things getting worse, but do not directly indicate perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post does not mention feeling like a burden or believing that others would be better off if the person were gone. There is no indication of negative self-perception or lack of self-worth.
3. While the post mentions a desire for change, it does not express a desire to escape from the perceived burdensomeness. The focus is on wanting things to improve and avoid hitting rock bottom, rather than wanting to alleviate the perceived burden on others."
"Consider this post: ""What I mean by this, is that they care to hear how you're doing and stuff, and they do care of your existence. For example, if you fall ill, they may say something like ""Well, I hope ____ feels better soon!"" That kind of thing. But a lot of people don't care about you, they care *of* you. If they aren't the kind of person who talks and listens to you, then I feel like that means they only care of you. I have a bunch of family members who I only talk to when I see them, like on holidays. Those people, unfortunately, don't care about me. They care of me. I feel like there's a difference. I don't know if know if these are warbled depression thoughts, or if I'm just realizing this, but it seems to be the case. I know telling people about depression is usually overwhelming, but I can't help but feel so brushed off. I hate when I tell people stuff like ""I'm not feeling too well lately, and my life has gotten pretty rough,"" and they'll simply dismiss it with an ""Oh, okay."" I can't help but feel so tiny and insignificant when this happens. Maybe I'm not being rational, but I feel like most people I know honestly don't care about me, but rather, again, of me."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a distinction between caring about someone and caring for someone, indicating a desire for deeper emotional connections and understanding. This suggests a potential lack of connectedness and inadequate belongingness.

2. They mention having family members whom they only talk to on holidays, implying a lack of regular and meaningful interactions with these individuals. This further contributes to a sense of disconnection and inadequate belonging.

3. The individual expresses frustration and sadness when people dismiss their feelings, indicating a lack of support and understanding from their social circle. This can contribute to feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction with their current state of connectedness.

Overall, the post highlights interpersonal risk factors, such as limited social connections, lack of emotional support, and feeling brushed off, which are indicative of thwarted belongingness and a psychologically-painful mental state."

The post mentions feeling brushed off and dismissed when sharing personal struggles and feelings. This suggests a lack of social support and understanding, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post expresses feeling insignificant and like most people do not care about the individual. These thoughts indicate a negative self-perception and a potential belief that others would be better off without them, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post also discusses the difference between people who care ""about"" the individual versus people who only care ""of"" the individual. This suggests a dissatisfaction with the quality of relationships and a desire for deeper connections, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness and perceived burdensomeness."
"Consider this post: ""I thought I was doing better, so I cut down on my antidepressants, like, in the spring. I was doing alright when university work wasn't so difficult.

The individual expresses feelings of self-doubt and worthlessness, indicating a potential lack of belongingness or connectedness.
2. They mention struggling with university work and feeling overwhelmed with deadlines and exams, which could contribute to feelings of inadequacy or failure.
3. The individual questions their decision to reduce their antidepressant medication, suggesting potential difficulties in managing their mental health and coping with their challenges.

"Consider this post: ""For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all.

Reasoning: The given post suggests that the individual is experiencing symptoms of depression, such as anhedonia (not enjoying life), lack of motivation, and feeling emotionless. These symptoms can contribute to a sense of disconnection and inadequate belongingness. However, the post also mentions being with friends and having moments when things are okay.

While this may indicate some level of apathy or ambivalence towards the holiday, it does not provide any evidence of a lack of connectedness or inadequate belongingness. The post does not mention feeling lonely, isolated, or having difficulties forming or maintaining relationships."
"Consider this post: ""In other words, just another New Years Eve."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1.

So many people there hate me. The work is just piling up and I cry in class almost once a week it seems. I had one shot at a decent job and I didn't get it. There's nowhere else near me where I can apply. But my boyfriend got a job at the same place. I'm volatile and emotional. I hurt everyone around me. I've driven everyone away. I have literally, and I mean literally, no one. I don't know why I'm like this. All I do is make other's lives hell. Fuck I want to die. I want to die as painfully as I can. I want to be flayed, burned, and disemboweled. It's what I deserve in life. I've caused so much pain for everyone around me. I fucking hate myself beyond words.

"Consider this post: ""I normally work out a lot but last year was so bad I even cancelled my gym membership. This year I actually started working out again and when I noticed I had started making some progress I made myself a goal to gain 10 kg this year (since I had lost some weight last year).

I just wanted to share this here because I actually felt really good about this, which is a feeling I very rarely experience nowadays. The thing is though now when I got home after NYE I don't feel this happiness at all anymore. I actually feel more alone and miserable than I've felt in weeks.""

"Consider this post: ""I've had suicidal thoughts from a very young age and have never felt able to tell anybody about them because, realistically, there's no reason I should be depressed. So many people have it so much worse than I do and it makes me feel like my emotions are invalid, and that if I were to actually acknowledge them to someone else it would seem like I'm being dramatic and attention-seeking. At this point I wish I could just give my life to someone else who actually has it bad because it feels like I'm wasting it."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions having suicidal thoughts from a young age, which is a clear indication of perceived burdensomeness. The individual feels that their life is not valuable and that others would be better off without them. This is a significant risk factor for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also expresses feelings of invalidation and guilt for experiencing depression when others have it worse. This further contributes to the individual's sense of being a burden and feeling like their emotions are not valid. This can increase the risk of perceived burdensomeness.

I need to clean my bedroom before I start my spring semester of school, and I don't want to just waste my break sleeping, but that's all I feel like I can do. I love to read and have been thinking about starting a blog for book reviews, which is something I'm still interested in, but I have absolutely no motivation to pick up a book or do anything except sleep or watch mindless TV. I guess I'm asking if anybody else has experienced this and if anybody has suggestions for how to get through this rut. It's so frustrating because I really do consider myself an ambitious and goal-oriented person, but the smallest things (even taking a shower or brushing my teeth) feel physically and mentally impossible at the moment.""

I get anxiety attacks often a lot of times and it's really hard for me to open up around here. Should've just stayed in college than come at the wrong place (ie. Here).

Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: This post does show signs of risk of thwarted belongingness. Here's the reasoning:

1. The individual mentions having had run-ins with counselors in the past, indicating a history of mental health struggles and potentially seeking help for them. Their parents' negative reaction and dismissal of their struggles, claiming they are just seeking attention, suggests a lack of support and understanding from their primary social group (family). This lack of support and invalidation can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and disconnectedness.

2. The individual expresses dissatisfaction with their academic performance and mentions reaching out to a teacher for help. This suggests a potential feeling of inadequacy and failure in their academic environment, which could further contribute to their sense of disconnectedness and lack of belonging.

3. The individual expresses a desire to avoid their parents knowing anything about their struggles, going as far as considering giving a fake phone number to their counselor. This desire to hide their true feelings and experiences from their parents indicates a lack of trust and open communication within their familial relationships, which can further exacerbate their sense of thwarted belongingness.

Overall, the post shows clear interpersonal risk factors of mental disturbance, including a lack of support from family, dissatisfaction with academic performance, and the desire to hide their struggles from their parents. These factors contribute to the individual's risk of thwarted belongingness."

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1.

The urgency and desperation in this situation suggest that the individual may be feeling responsible for her well-being and fearful of the consequences if something were to happen to her. This sense of responsibility and fear can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.

3. The individual mentions being out of the country and only being able to contact the girlfriend over the internet. This distance and inability to physically be there to support her can further enhance feelings of helplessness, guilt, and burden.

"Consider this post: ""So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared. You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty?

"Consider this post: ""So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried.

You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty?

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling sad for unknown reasons for a year, feeling empty and crying for no reason, and engaging in self-harm behaviors like hitting oneself. These feelings and behaviors indicate emotional distress and a negative self-perception, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions attempting to overdose on medication and expressing a desire to die. These thoughts and behaviors are indicative of suicidal ideation and a belief that one's presence is burdensome to others.
3. The post describes opening up to parents about these struggles, but instead of receiving support, they were met with invalidation, contempt, and a wish for them to die. This rejection and lack of understanding from parents can contribute to feelings of being a burden and increase the risk of perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post expresses a desire for help and mentions that the only thing holding them back from acting on their suicidal thoughts is their boyfriend's encouragement to fight. This suggests a desperate need for support and intervention to address the perceived burdensomeness and prevent self-harm or suicide."
