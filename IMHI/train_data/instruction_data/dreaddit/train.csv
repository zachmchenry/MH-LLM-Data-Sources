A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby.

Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events.

Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me - an e-mail to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her, because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up, and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.""

Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck. I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety.

"Consider this post: ""Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry... He'd utterly lose control of himself.

Reasoning: The poster's language and description of traumatic experiences suggest that they have experienced severe emotional and physical abuse.

The mention of their girlfriend's previous suicide attempt adds an additional layer of concern and suggests that the poster is dealing with a highly distressing and potentially dangerous situation."
"Consider this post: ""Worse than that develop the same anxiety disorder. Again another reason to finish the relationship. I really love her but cannot and WILL NOT embarrass her like I did at the wedding. My plan is to go talk to a private physiatrist and see what they think. I don’t believe medication is the only answer but if it helps in conjunction with therapy, a healthy lifestyle and meditation then I will try it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster is expressing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment, indicating that they may be suffering from ongoing stress. They mention the development of an anxiety disorder and their intention to seek help from a private psychiatrist, indicating that they recognize the need for professional intervention to cope with their stress.

"Consider this post: ""I apologized for taking up too much of his time and space and for not respecting his boundaries, and for storming off angry; the worst part is that he eventually said he didn't accept my apology because I was still ruining his day with my insistence he apologize for speaking to me with a ""retarded"" voice. So, is our relationship doomed?   ---   **tl;dr**: My bf and I fight too much, and I think it's both our faults while he thinks it's only mine/my brain chemistry's fault. Am I crazy, or do we need to break up?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates high levels of emotional distress and frustration. The poster apologizes for their behavior and acknowledges that they may have crossed boundaries, indicating that they may feel guilty or paralyzed by their actions. They also express disappointment and hurt when their partner refuses to accept their apology and dismisses their concerns. The phrase ""ruining his day with my insistence he apologize"" suggests that the poster may be experiencing feelings of guilt and self-doubt. The overall tone of the post reflects a high level of stress and suggests that the poster may be struggling with their relationship and questioning their own sanity."
"Consider this post: ""Normally, my anxiety is very well controlled. I meditate every morning for \~15 minutes and have been in therapy for the better part of the last 3 or 4 years. I feel WAY better than I used to, and on a day to day basis things are great. Buttt every once in a while (A handful of times a year, tops) something will realllly set me over the edge, and send me into an intense anxiety spiral where I compulsively ask 5 or so different friends for advice on what to do, post a lot of threads online about what I should do, and ruminate on the topic for days or weeks. Sometimes I'll have chats in messenger about whatever it is that will draw out over an entire 3-4 hour period."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster acknowledges that they have anxiety but states that it is normally well-controlled. They have developed coping mechanisms such as meditation and therapy. The intense anxiety spiral that occurs a few times a year may be distressing in the moment, but it is not indicative of ongoing stress. The poster's behavior during these episodes, such as seeking advice from friends and posting online, may be a way for them to manage and gain support during times of heightened anxiety. Overall, the post does not suggest that the poster is suffering from stress on a regular basis."
"Consider this post: ""Sure it was almost 3 years ago (in July) two months into my first job out of university. I got bit in the leg and continued on like it was nothing. I only fell apart October 2016. I must have been living in survival mode until I got the call that the man who saved my life was getting recognized with a bravery award. Hearing those words, I literally felt my chest rip open and haven't been able to close the wound since."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster's language suggests a high level of emotional distress and trauma. They describe falling apart and feeling their chest rip open upon hearing that the person who saved their life is being recognized. This suggests that the poster has been struggling with the emotional aftermath of a traumatic event and is experiencing ongoing stress.

"Consider this post: ""There was no need for child care. When our daughter was 3, my husband, her father, taught her the word privacy. He then explained to her 3 yr old self what it means so she could understand. It was so cute when I would try and help her with her bath, and she would say ""no mommy, I need my PRIVATY..LOL. we encouraged this as she got older."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post is positive and lighthearted. The poster describes a cute and funny anecdote about their daughter learning the word ""privacy"" and using it in a playful manner.

"Consider this post: ""What is for you the most relatable portrayal you have seen/heard I don't have PTSD but reading a retired Marines blog I noticed that when he was talking about his PTSD it sounded a lot like Rick in the Walking Dead. Ill explain for those who have never seen it. Rick was the leader of his group during a zombie outbreak. He killed his best friend twice (technically) and his wife died along with most everyone he knew."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is discussing a topic that may be related to stress (PTSD) but does not express any personal distress or emotional turmoil. The post is more focused on discussing a relatable portrayal of PTSD in a TV show, rather than expressing personal experiences or seeking support for their own stress.

"Consider this post: ""I've always connected my self worth with how well I do in school. Right now, I'm failing the last class I need to graduate. The final exam is 2 semester worth of stuff that I never really understood. This is my last chance to graduate. If I don't pass I wont get into the grad school that conditionally accepted me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of self-worth being tied to academic performance and the stress of failing the last class needed to graduate. The mention of the final exam covering two semesters' worth of material that the poster never understood indicates a high level of anxiety and pressure.

"Consider this post: ""I typically would not care in the slightest about things like that but I feel as if since my good friends basically turned their backs on me that I am at a loss? If my good friends did before does that mean everyone else will too? **TLDR: GF and I broke up. She is trying to turn people against me. What can I do?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of loss, vulnerability, and fear due to their friends turning against them. The mention of their ex-girlfriend trying to turn people against them highlights a distressing situation. The poster's question about whether everyone else will also turn against them suggests a lack of trust and heightened anxiety. These emotions and concerns indicate that the poster is likely suffering from stress."
"Consider this post: ""u mind you my mom is 5’1 and he is 5’9. now her jaw hurts and pops when she opens it wide. so this is my dilemma: i am a very emotional person. my emotional skin is raw and any slight change in others affects me greatly. side note: i had developed ptsd growing up from being scared of my older brother (saw him and heard him fighting with my family many many times growing up) but since he moved out for good (i hope) its gone away.""

"Consider this post: ""I've been out of work for nine months, and it's finally catching up to me. When I lost my job in January, I took a sabbatical for a few months; it was necessary at the time. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have set up my phone with call blockers when the bill collectors began calling. I couldn't tell the difference between a potential employer and something which would stress me out given the slew of incoming calls with unknown numbers. During my time off I invested my time to build new skills, donating them to a gaming community, and hanging out for escapism to the point of obsession."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster acknowledges that they have been out of work for nine months and that it is starting to impact them. They mention the stress of bill collectors calling and not being able to differentiate between potential employers and other stress-inducing calls. They also mention obsessively hanging out in a gaming community for escapism. These statements indicate that the poster is experiencing stress related to their prolonged unemployment and the challenges it brings. The language used suggests frustration and a sense of being overwhelmed, but it does not indicate ongoing or chronic stress. Therefore, the label assigned is ""No."""
"Consider this post: ""EVERY TIME I say, ""I've got a job!"" she gives me some kind of bullshit reason the place is not a good idea. She threatened to boot me back out on the street for ""not taking her word for it"" when I explain I need the job anyway. BTW her girlfriend owns the house. They've lived here together for 2 years and she has been making up bullshit reasons she can't work the whole time."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster's language indicates frustration and anger towards someone who is preventing them from getting a job. They describe feeling threatened and being given ""bullshit reasons"" for not taking the job. The overall tone of the post suggests a high level of stress and tension caused by the situation."
"Consider this post: ""Sometimes, when I finally got out of bed and stood up, I felt like ""Ugh, *finally*"". Still, it did not happen every morning, and even when it did, I still felt rested from the long sleep, so I thought no more of it. Also, they were never nightmares. Sadly, my body got habituated to the sleep-component of Mirtazapine after about five months, and my old warped sleep cycle slowly creeped back into my life. The only benefit left in the medicine was the mild mental cushioning it provided, but at the same time I started to suspect that what I needed wasn't cushioning but to make new constructive life decisions, that only I could make."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates that the poster is reflecting on their experience with a specific medication and its effects on their sleep. While they mention some challenges with sleep and the medication, there is no indication of emotional distress or a broader expression of stress. The overall tone of the post is informative and introspective, rather than emotionally charged. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the poster is currently suffering from stress."
"Consider this post: ""Throwaway because my normal account is a common username for me.... Anyway, I've been in a lesbian relationship for near 7 years. The first 2 was long distance but then i moved from NY to TX to be with her. Everything was generally okay until we moved into a new apartment back in December. It isnt the best but its a roof over our heads and it's relatively cheap."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

I have also been working out which has inevitably eased my depression and made my anxiety more tolerable but its still obviously taking hold of my life. Well here i am at this present moment, I have been contemplating having a sit down with my parents and telling them about my depression (pretty sure they already know, they just don't want to adress it). It had been hard, my parents come home at 9:00 PM and don't want to be bothered with me. they go straight to their rooms and the only time they are willing to talk is when they tell me to clean."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in this post suggests that the poster is experiencing depression and anxiety, which are common symptoms of stress. They mention using 5-htp and working out as strategies to manage their mental health, indicating that they are actively trying to cope with their symptoms. The mention of contemplating talking to their parents about their depression suggests that the poster may be feeling isolated and unsupported, which can also contribute to stress.

Overall, the post demonstrates ongoing emotional distress and a potential underlying chronic stress."
"Consider this post: ""Do not drink a lot and only eat mild food before and during event. Gave myself permission to leave for any reason whenever I wanted. Giving myself control has allowed me to return to meetings at work in peace. I have been doing this for about 24 years. No one knows I have these fears."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is discussing a strategy they have been using for 24 years in order to feel more in control and at peace during work meetings.

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is expressing disappointment and frustration with their partner's behavior, as well as their own illness. While the situation may be stressful and upsetting, there is no indication that the poster is suffering from ongoing stress.

"Consider this post: ""[Here is the link to her <url> ***Do not read below this if you have a weak stomach*** My friend has a very sweet toy poodle mix that was recently attacked. A much larger dog attacked Paige's (my friends dog) face and ripped off her lower jaw, to the point it was hanging down by just the remaining skin and fur that was attached. Paige went into a 24hr vet and had emergency surgery that allowed the jaw to be re-attached but the middle of the jaw (from canine tooth to canine tooth) had to be completely removed so Paige essentially has a large hole in her lower jaw now.""

Later, they told her that her baby wouldn't survive at birth."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster provides information about a co-worker who recently gave birth and received conflicting medical information about the health of the baby. While this situation may be emotionally challenging for the co-worker, there is no indication that the poster themselves is expressing any emotional distress or stress in their post. The language used is factual and objective, without any indication of personal emotional involvement. Therefore, the label of ""No"" would be assigned, as the post does not suggest that the poster suffers from stress."
"Consider this post: ""I'm fine, or so I thought. All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on. I've tried so many different types of medications and combinations thereof, more than 10 for sure, and even underwent electro-convulsive therapy, but nothing helped. It was not until this past summer that I thought to try therapy, something I had actively avoided. I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster acknowledges that they have been dealing with various mental health issues, including anger, alcohol abuse, depression, and difficulties with focus, which they attribute to their bipolar disorder.

She keeps saying it affects my motivation and depression, but it helps with bot the GAD and social anxiety."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in this post indicates that the poster is struggling with making a decision and is conflicted about whether they should continue using marijuana despite their therapist's advice.

This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway. However I could understand if others in my complex would be distressed or anxious by this, especially if they live on the first floor (I'm fortunate to live higher up on the fourth floor).""

We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months.

Overall, the post clearly indicates that the poster is experiencing ongoing stress and significant life challenges."
"Consider this post: ""We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower. And he said he ""hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible"" but said that he ""accepts that this is the way I am"" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide, smiled at him and small talked. We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day. This made him even more mad."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a situation where their partner exhibits controlling behavior by monitoring their data usage and making negative comments about their responsibility. This behavior likely caused stress in the poster, as evidenced by their lack of response and attempt to let it slide. The subsequent development of the park being closed further increases the partner's anger and adds to the stressful situation. Overall, the language used suggests that the poster is experiencing ongoing stress in their relationship."

"Consider this post: ""and how that would intersect with a potential partner’s attitude. You’ve probably seen the posts on here: a woman gave birth four months ago and her husband is pissed off because her breasts are sore and he can’t play with them. A woman gave birth three months ago and her husband is pressuring her for PiV sex even though she is still uncomfortable. A woman doesn’t enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because it’s a mammary gland and not a sex organ, and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isn’t aware of other erogenous zones. These were posts I remember reading on here for some relevant examples, but I can go on."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is discussing the topic of how childbirth and breastfeeding can impact a person's attitude towards sexual intimacy.

She apologized and stated that she wasn't trying to cause problems. She said he was in prison for something that happened a long time ago (looks like he was on felony probation and did something to get it revoked), sent pictures of her children, who are all one year older than the children him and I share, and told me his mother had passed.""

"Consider this post: ""Things between us were amicable until that point. Now, the atmosphere is VERY different.

You can read about it in my post history but basically I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for pretty much no reason, the therapists responsible for it just covered themselves up and lied about it. It greatly affected me. I would definitely consider it to be a traumatic event, not just because of the actual events that transpired and the conditions of the hospital (which are pretty bad) but also just the huge betrayal of trust."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions that their girlfriend thinks they might have PTSD due to an incident in 2014.

All I could do was try to retreat, but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time).

It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald! In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago. (I'm so grateful that they are no longer married. He is such an excellent parent/person NOW that he doesn't care about ""undermining her"".)""

I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

Others came before, but she's the first to actually show interest in the long term. She's made these ambitious plans for our distant future, and I don't have it in my heart to tell her it'll never happen. She's the first girl to show me daily how much she cares for me, and the impending thought of breaking her heart is killing me.""

Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers. And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies... He played nice for my vacation-- respecting my boundaries and acting only as a friend. He showed me the island and was nothing but kind and hospitable to my family...""

He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.

I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all. I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned.

"Consider this post: ""I tend not to like driving long distances in cars with people in unfamiliar places still but I feel good just that I am back on the road even if I don't drive the car. This took me about five years to reach this level of comfort. All of my fears:  I started to exercise hard every single day. Heavy exercise would defeat the fear in most cases or make it easy to manage. If I did not exercise, I was a walking fear bomb.""

At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation. I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone. But I also want to hate him and leave. So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

Eventually he decided to close up for the night and I went back up to the house, tipsy and confused about what had just happened, but glad I had bargained some time. I got myself on the dole and the rope that was against my neck seemed to loosen just a little bit. However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies.

I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation."" In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her). All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.""

We moved into a house together, I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later, leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain, again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid.

I have osteoarthritis in my right hip, which slips in the socket and causes a lot of pain, and this has all had an ongoing impact on the rest of my body as my back often spasms or locks and I have issues with a frozen shoulder that limits the use of my right arm.

It's not like we never do anything, I just seem to still be attached to this idea.

They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere.

I went twice a week and it felt like my whole life revolved around trauma."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions having a tough time finding another therapist, but there is no indication of emotional distress or ongoing stress.

However, I need to finance med but I need to work on my current stature to get the money but this job makes me anxious to the point that I am having refluxes because of stress just the thought of working on it. The problem with me is I know I can do for the meantime this job but it was a mistaken path, I could have done dev since it involves little customer interaction.

"Consider this post: ""I assumed she would answer the question, or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy, or she would interpret the transference. But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"".

My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing. I don’t know what to do."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster is describing a cyclical pattern of retreating, revising, and retriggering themselves in order to avoid slipping back into denial. This indicates that they are struggling with processing and accepting a traumatic event. They express a desire to not live a lie but acknowledge that sometimes the lie is what helps them function.

All-in-all, I like this guy, he's been an OK manager to me, I've gotten all of my raises since I've been under him, he has kids, so he understands me as a parent, etc. Am I making too big of a deal out of this? I thought about going to HR about it, but I'm in a position where I can't jeopardize this job, and I'm not the most well-liked person on the team (nothing that I did, I was hired externally for a position that 3 internals wanted), for whatever that's worth. Your thoughts?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses some annoyance and frustration with their manager's comment, but there is no indication of ongoing emotional distress or anxiety.

"Consider this post: ""She still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it), but frankly, I'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. I do like her as a friend, but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. My questions are: should I just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person, or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? And regardless of this, should I start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?""

"Consider this post: ""how is it possible that he can drive and use his fist to punch you? did you do something wrong?"". The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department (and by the way they offer counselling - nothing else). To this day, they have not arrested him because apparently the attack occurred in the middle of two districts (apparently it's really hard to determine which district is responsible) and because of bureaucratic issues, the man has not been taken to questioning.

Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society).

My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell. I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting.

"Consider this post: ""She has a history of being extremely over the top, and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know. She did apologize a good day later, but only very vaguely about using cuss words and in a ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" kind of sense. I'm guessing a traditional ""we need to talk, it's just not working out"" approach would just end up with her blowing up again, and since all my past relationships ended very amicably I'm not sure what to expect. Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially ""ghosting,"" but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation. How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes being verbally abused and having their trust broken by their partner. They express concern about the partner potentially flipping out if they try to break up with them. This indicates a high level of emotional distress and anxiety, as well as a fear of confrontation.

"Consider this post: ""?

"Consider this post: ""It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about, then cry, and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....) I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works? Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do ""stress relieving activities"" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster's language indicates that they are experiencing confusion and frustration about their emotions and the concept of stress.

"Consider this post: ""It’s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to “protect” me. He won’t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I don’t answer (I don’t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying). I understand that the events were traumatic for Tom. I recognize that every time I go to a follow up medical appointment he is frightened. I understand that the fact that I still take medication scares him."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

"Consider this post: ""I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

"Consider this post: ""Unfortunately, it also affects pretty much everything in my life, including working memory and everyday events. It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either. The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown. I was wondering if maybe now that I know why I most likely struggle with memory, I can go back to get more solid treatment options? If so, who should I see for help?""

Reasoning: The poster indicates that their stress is affecting multiple areas of their life, including their working memory and language development.

"Consider this post: ""No, that's not an exaggeration but I wish I was. While I was driving last Tuesday I got extremely lightheaded, sweaty, and then pulled over and vomited blood all over the interior of my car. After a few moments of wonder if 'this was it' and deciding 'it definitely wasn't it, not on a highway' I snapped by myself back to what life was left and drove to the next exit to find help. My SO has a great summary of why this ended up costing so much money, but it's a sequence of very unfortunate events.

And we can feel guilty about things we have done, we can feel guilty about things we didn't do, but wish we had, and of course we can feel guilty for nothing at all.

Overall, the language and content of the post suggest that the poster is suffering from ongoing stress."
"Consider this post: ""The idea of what ISPs can do once the lack rules are truly active have made me feel sick to my stomach. I can't sleep and it is affecting my school life. I can't afford to pay ransom to the Corporate Fascist Thugs who wish to cableize the internet and I can't stand the idea of the internet becoming like that of China and North Korea. We are still fighting, but I'm still paranoid and every day that gets closer to April 23rd makes me feel more infuriated and panicky. I feel under attack and very life about to be destroyed.""

I'm checking snapchat scores, social media activitiy, last active etc which i know is already grounds for unhealthy relationships. The problem is when we were together, and whilst we were texting chat its absolutely perfect until the past week. The texts are shorter, my messages are being ignored (she's online but not reading my message) for hours on end, there's no good night / good morning message, it's all very limited and short. I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility, in that 'yes everything is fine, i don't need to be in constant communication with you,' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.""

"Consider this post: ""I am writing on behalf of my friend and colleague (with his permission) who has watched his daughter Laney steadily deteriorate after suddenly suffering massive strokes due to a disease known as Moya Moya, which is where the body tries to compensate for inadequate bloodflow to the brain by sending capillaries that invariably burst. She is now in terminal condition and the family is facing a staggering mountain of medical bills. The icing on the cake is that the onset of the strokes occured while Laney's mom was 8 month's pregnant. The last year and a half has been horrific. I've posted the [link to a GoFundMe <url> started by Laney's Godmother in the hopes that there may be some of you who would like to contribute."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses sympathy and concern for their friend and colleague and provides information about their daughter's medical condition and the financial struggles that they are facing. While the situation is undoubtedly extremely difficult and stressful for the family, the poster does not express their own personal emotional distress or reveal any signs of stress.

Therefore, there is no indication that the poster is suffering from stress based on this post."
"Consider this post: ""During one of our many discussions, she compared it to me playing with people on my friends list. I explained that usually we are in game friends and only really speak about the game. A few times she offered to talk about in game stuff only with her friends. The last time she offered, I accepted feeling that it would solve my issue. Once I accepted her offer, she backpedaled almost immediately during the same conversation."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

However, there is no indication of emotional distress or ongoing stress in the post. The poster's language is matter-of-fact and does not convey a high level of distress or anxiety.

"Consider this post: ""He did threaten to walk out when I tried to crack a third, and I stopped. He says this is so rewarding for him, but is really open about how tough it has been as well. The therapist, though she is more closed mouthed and less personally emotional, has said she has required supervision several times over me. No matter how nice they are, if I fuck up months of progress, decisions about where this is going seem likely. Getting this out seems to have helped a fair bit."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is discussing a difficult situation with their partner and therapist. While there are mentions of challenges and potential consequences, there is no indication of ongoing stress or emotional distress.

I’m crying and yelling and he is yelling at me and shoving a broom in my face and I just tell him I’m taking all my stuff out of the bathroom so now it’s on the shelves that I just cleared off.

"Consider this post: ""I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault. I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking. This must mean that I am truly worthless and a waste of life. I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this, because I deserve this hard life. Has anyone experienced horrible burn out because of PTSD/OCD?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

Reasoning: The poster is recounting a past relationship that involved ups and downs, including infidelity and abuse. While the content of the post suggests that the poster experienced difficult and challenging emotions, there is no indication of ongoing stress.

"Consider this post: ""Also, to answer the million dollar question everyone has, ""How does this happen to someone who outearns her abuser by a factor of 6?"" I wish people talked more about the other side of financial abuse. We hear all about the men who financially abuse their partners by prohibiting them from having a job, or denying them access to bank accounts, and that sort of thing. There's also the side where they monitor every account and become completely terrifying if their higher earning partner so much as buys one cup of coffee that they didn't approve of. They spend all her money on random crap that they can pass off as household expenses."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates that the poster is frustrated and wants to shed light on a particular issue (financial abuse) that is not widely discussed. While the topic and content of the post may be distressing, there is no indication that the poster is personally experiencing ongoing stress. The post appears to be more informative and aimed at raising awareness, rather than expressing personal emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""If you withhold financial information from this type of abuser, they will get it out of you somehow. Trust me. It isn't pretty. I withheld my credit card numbers for a year, and I paid every day for it. Anyway, I'm totally ranting at this point, but it was seriously amazing to find one person in this entire world who actually confirmed that what I experienced in trying to access help was real."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: the poster is expressing frustration and anger towards an abusive person, but there is no indication of ongoing emotional distress or anxiety. The language used suggests a sense of relief in finding validation from someone else who has had a similar experience, rather than a personal struggle with stress. The post is a specific rant about a past situation, rather than a broader expression of emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I was feeling sick, I had work to do, I was tired, and all I could do was shout that I didn't want to be so close to the next step and get slingshotted back because of something I didn't know was coming. I know it's my fault. I know I should've been more careful, been more prepared. But I can't do this. My boyfriend has been begging me to keep the baby, and it makes me feel torn."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster's language reflects a high level of emotional distress and feelings of being overwhelmed. They describe feeling sick, tired, and shouting out of frustration. They express feelings of inadequacy and a sense of being unprepared for a situation. Additionally, they mention feeling torn about a decision regarding keeping a baby, which adds to their overall stress and emotional burden. The combination of these factors indicates that the poster is likely suffering from stress."
"Consider this post: ""Nothing was bothering them. Nobody was being a bully at school. Their grades started to slip. I was asking the right questions but they kept saying nothing was going on. Fast forward six months."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post does not provide any indication of the poster's emotions or feelings. It simply states that their child's grades started to slip and that they were asking questions but not getting any information. Without any information about how the poster is feeling or any indication of emotional distress, it is not possible to determine if they are suffering from stress."
"Consider this post: ""My husband has poor impulse control (his words) especially when he gets angry or frustrated. I've noticed he often will take out frustration on the dog (he's a rescue who is legitimately hard to manage). He's never hit me or hit the dog, but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline. For example the other day, the dog was having a lot of anxiety and being bad and barking in the car at every dog we passed. When we arrived home my partner got out of the car and pulled the dogs leash so hard that he fell out the door into his back."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a concerning pattern of their husband's behavior, indicating that he has poor impulse control when angry or frustrated. They also mention that he takes out his frustration on the dog, demonstrating a lack of emotional regulation. The specific incident described, where the husband pulls the dog's leash so hard that it falls out of the car, is an example of physical aggression towards the dog. This behavior could be a result of heightened stress levels, as the husband's poor impulse control and aggression may stem from underlying emotional turmoil. Therefore, it is likely that the poster is suffering from ongoing stress due to their husband's behavior."
"Consider this post: ""I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state, I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own, that I can’t tell anyone about. I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps. Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go. So It’s been largely untreated, not throw lack of trying.  I can’t see my condition changing."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in this post, such as ""I can't go to someone when I'm not coping"" and ""I hate going through this on my own"", indicates that the poster is struggling with their emotional well-being. They express a fear of reaching out for support and have developed a phobia towards therapists. The mention of multiple therapists and appointments suggests that they have made attempts to seek treatment but have been unable to engage. The overall tone of hopelessness and the belief that their condition will not improve further supports the conclusion that the poster is suffering from ongoing stress."
"Consider this post: ""After I took care of healing my self, my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman. He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past. I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship. It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency. I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in this post reflects a high level of worry, fear, and frustration. The poster expresses concern for another person who is currently dating their abusive ex-partner, indicating that they are still emotionally invested in the situation. They also express a desire for more transparency and a hypothetical solution to prevent others from falling into potentially abusive relationships. Overall, the emotional distress and preoccupation with the situation suggest that the poster is likely suffering from stress."
"Consider this post: ""I didn't have time to text a lot like I used to, and certainly couldn't realistically plan trips to see her anymore. She was plainly unhappy with me for not being as communicative anymore, but things really came to a head when I began dating someone. Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman, which was shocking to me because I trusted her, and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community. She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa). As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone)."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is describing a conflict with a friend, but there is no indication of emotional distress or anxiety in the language used. While the situation may be upsetting and disappointing, there is no mention of ongoing stress or emotional struggle. The post primarily focuses on the dynamics of the friendship and the changes that occurred as a result of the poster dating someone else."
"Consider this post: ""I've been struggling to work/be employed ever since my first job gave me anxiety 6 years ago but I feel like only now I've finally cracked it. In December I managed to work on a contract full time in an office for 6 weeks with only 1 massive panic attack. But now, I'm about to have 3 part time jobs. They're not the sort of jobs I would love to have \(I kind of want a job where I can talk to other people in the workplace\) but I found that social media/community manager gigs are so flexible and are working at home jobs. So I stay anxiety free by setting my own hours and being in control, and I make more money than I would have if I worked at a cafe or at a restaurant."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster acknowledges that they have struggled with anxiety in the past, but they also mention that they have found a solution that works for them. They have identified jobs that allow them to work from home and set their own hours, which helps to reduce their anxiety. They express satisfaction with their current situation and state that they are anxiety-free. While the poster may have experienced stress and anxiety in the past, their current post does not indicate ongoing stress or emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I don’t believe my list is long and I tried to find the cheapest items. I have high hopes I’ll be employed by the middle of July. I’m ready to pay it forward. Don’t want to be in this situation ever again. I’ve attached the link."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster does not express any specific emotions in this post that would indicate stress. They mention trying to find the cheapest items and their hope of being employed by a certain date, but there is no indication of emotional distress or anxiety. The overall tone of the post is more positive and hopeful, suggesting that the poster is not currently suffering from stress."
"Consider this post: ""My Daughter was recently in a domestic violence dispute. The other party was arrested and there was a gun involved. They are both under 21.

She has not attempted to move on and is waiting for the order to be lifted in order to reunite with him."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a concerning situation involving domestic violence, but there is no indication of the poster's emotional state or distress. While it is certainly a stressful situation for the poster's daughter, the post does not provide enough information to determine if the poster themselves is suffering from stress."

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster's language and the urgency in their request indicate that they are likely experiencing a high level of stress. They mention being in an emergency situation and losing their housing soon, which suggests that they are under significant pressure to find a new living situation quickly.

No friends (yet), family, and he misses our son terribly. He’s having a really rough time with missing all of the milestones of babies first year and is depressed often... when he’s sad he gets angry."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates that the poster is experiencing a high level of emotional distress. She expresses feeling guilty for her own emotions of sadness and loneliness, which suggests that she may be internalizing her own struggles and putting her partner's well-being above her own. The mention of her partner's depression and anger also suggests that the poster may be dealing with the stress of trying to support someone who is struggling emotionally. Overall, the post reflects a challenging and stressful situation for the poster, indicating that she is likely suffering from stress."

Most will be terrified, and could end up trusting the wrong people by not seeing signs that more “street wise” folks might have."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

I nearly always reply within 20 mins if I'm not busy because I'm still in the excited pahse, but I get a lot of 3/4 wait times with a read receipt, with him coming on and off whatsapp within that period before I get a reply.

Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.""

I didn’t have a problem with it because I am shy and so bad at conversation it kind of took the spot light off of me even tho that’s kinda what I was there to see her for. Also from the beginning she was kinda well very unprofessional and I knew this.

Just wondering if anyone with any experience in talk therapy would share anything she may be able to talk about or focus on that could help a lot?

They talk about their personal journey and a positive experience of finding a sense of peace."
"Consider this post: ""My wife (we've been together 8 years) however is determined to 'finish the job'. Her father taught her much of what she knows and that is certainly a factor as to why she is an constructual engineer... But unlike her father she isn't a certified electrician or plumber nor is she especially skilled at carpentry. The issue is that we live 5 hours away and even if we did go *every* weekend to work on the house it would take well over a year to even get it into a acceptable state, let alone 'finished' and sellable. I brought up the idea of getting contractors to finish the house."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is expressing frustration and concern about the time it will take to finish their house. They are questioning their wife's ability to complete all the necessary construction work on her own and suggesting the idea of hiring contractors.

The post is focused on the practicalities of the situation rather than the poster's emotional state."
"Consider this post: ""For context, I'm working through my last year of grad school, living alone currently with not many strong friendships in the area, and my Dad has been dying of cancer since September, so it's a stressful and lonely time. At first, I was quite excited about getting married. But for the last 3 months or so, all it does is fill me with dread and worry. When I've visited her, I've found myself falling into a deep funk. I often find myself wishing she would break up with me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

"Consider this post: ""When I was 16 my braces were removed due to bone loss caused by Pre-juvenile periodontitis. My orthodontist had advised against a retainer because of cost and not believing I would need it. So sometime around my 17th year my teeth began to shift, horribly. Now I'm left with a horribly crooked and hanging front tooth, and have been terrified to speak to, or smile at anyone for years. It's absolutely destroyed my self esteem, and I've contemplated suicide many times because of it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates a high level of emotional distress and despair. The poster describes the impact of their crooked tooth on their self-esteem and reveals that they have contemplated suicide as a result.

I've had some promising leads but I found and a piece for a job that is at a lighting company that would combine the best of what I went to school for and my real world work experience. I got a call a few days ago but couldn't get an interview scheduled because during the call the hr lady got an email that the person I would interview with would be unavailable and I didn't have my work schedule right in front me so we decided to talk again the next day once we both had an idea of what the schedules for each side would be. Well the next day I called her and she still hadnt heard back from the person I would interview with and promised to call me the next day."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is expressing frustration and disappointment with the interview scheduling process for a potential job opportunity.

"Consider this post: ""I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive, the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me. I am indian and he is white. I have been in the US since I was 6 and if you ever spoke with me on the phone, you would never be able to guess that I am indian.""

The poster describes obsessing about a particular issue, being unable to stay positive, and experiencing extreme negativity and crying when drinking with friends. The mention of the poster's boyfriend criticizing her weight and considering ending the relationship further adds to the stress that the poster is experiencing. The mention of the poster's cultural background and the fact that she feels the need to mention her ability to pass as non-Indian suggests that she may be dealing with additional pressures and insecurities.

"Consider this post: ""She was unemployed and toyed with the idea of answering ads from strangers to perform fetish tasks for money, to include nudity (but no sex). It really wrecked me that she would consider that. She brought it up once again not too long ago (not seriously) and I flipped out. She was working as a nanny for a long time and I was very insecure about her and her boss because of my fear that she would be willing to do sex work for money. Now, she has never done any sex work for money and we agreed that it is not something I am comfortable with and she will not do it, so that's not an issue."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of insecurity and distress regarding their partner's consideration of performing fetish tasks for money. However, they clarify that their partner has never actually engaged in this type of work and that they have reached an agreement that it will not happen.

If it was the two of us, we could work it through but my relationship with G after so many telling offs, heart to hearts, explanations about his actions and their consequences, still goads me to get a rise. This is a woman who won't back down easily and will portray very intelligent coniving questions which have left me feeling dominated, under control and manipulated for a couple of years now. The one guiding light for us to work through it is my younger two children and how much I adore them. Still,in this current situation, there's is a seemingly insurmountable wall of emotions from all parties which would need a huge amount of effort to even bring us to the negotiating table."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a challenging and emotionally charged situation, but there is no indication of ongoing stress or emotional distress. The poster acknowledges the difficulties they are facing but also highlights a potential guiding light and a motivation to work through the situation.

"Consider this post: ""Well, I've been on an anti-depressant now, and I definitely feel less depressed and motivated but my anxiety has gotten slightly worse. I explained all my symptoms to the dr I saw today and expressed my concerns to her about taking benzos every day (family history of addiction and I find myself to have a very obsessive personality.) and she totally agreed with me and said I probably have GAD along with the depression. She added an anti-seizure med as a mood stabilizer and told me that should hopefully level out how I am feeling and take care of the anxiety that is probably being brought on by the anti-depressant. I am so happy that a dr actually listened to me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster acknowledges that their anxiety has gotten slightly worse since starting their anti-depressant medication, but they also express relief and gratitude that their concerns were listened to and addressed by their doctor.

She started a gofundme with more information about her issues and the steps that she has taken thus far to avoid asking for monetary donations (and is even offering trade for art), please take a look and consider donating. Anything (even just $5 so she has gas to get to the doctor) will help immensely and is literally life changing for her. Thanks for your time! <url>"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

"Consider this post: ""When I have a thought and that thought makes me feel good, it is because that thought is true, that thought is in alignment with my true nature, according to my higher self\infinite intelligence that thought is correct, it is the right way for me “define” myself and to go in life. When someone says to you “You are beautiful”, “I love you”, “I enjoy being around you”, … That makes you feel good, because those thoughts are TRUE, those thoughts are showing you who you are, you are loved, you are beautiful, you are and incredible person to be around with. (In my case, I feel in heaven when someone says to me “You make me feel amazing” 🙂 ) The same goes with your on thoughts and perspectives (that’s what you attract every time btw), when you define yourself/think of yourself in a way that makes you feel good, like “I feel worthy”, “I love myself”, “I love being me”, “I truly like my new shirt”, “I’m having so much fun”, “I’m at peace and relaxed”, you are going in the right way, the right direction,  forward and aligned with your dreams and passions.

"Consider this post: ""I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (theoretically CPTSD but that's not an official diagnosis so whatever). It's been 3 years since I escaped my abuser who abused me for 3 years as well. However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world. That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me. On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions being diagnosed with PTSD, which is a mental health condition commonly associated with high levels of stress. They also mention being abused by their ex-partner for three years, which is a traumatic experience that can lead to ongoing stress and anxiety.

Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing intense emotions, specifically ""violently sobbing,"" which suggests a high level of distress.

I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling, but it didn’t go so well since she felt like I was being rude, so while I am open to trying again, I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved?

I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run, but there are like always people around and it drives me insane. I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap, attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).""

Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"". I was so upset the entire day.

I came back after about a month to the DFW metroplex where I reside now with my dad, step mom and 6 siblings.

I don't really know anyone else in my family on either sides, other than my mom, dad, and my brother. I have never really been close to anyone in my entire life besides my grandparents on my mom's side, and my music teacher.

But it’s still bad enough that I can’t do much for myself, and I just don’t understand why they can’t believe that. I think they must see me as a burden or something because it seems like they don’t think I’m worth helping if my problem stems from anxiety rather than a different(“real”) illness. and they’ve decided they are the judges of that, not me or my doctors. I just don’t know what to do."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses frustration and feeling misunderstood by others.

"Consider this post: ""Someone I know has been compulsively chattering their teeth. They told me it started because they could feel their teeth wobble a little when they clenched their teeth together while feeling them with their finger (we all know this is just one of those weird tricks the teeth play on you) but it's become compulsive now. They told me they feel ill from it. They don't have any anxiety issues and the chattering is just a result of the above but I can see how it would become one. What can be done to make this go away?""

He would always repeat to me, “Manuel, I don’t know how much longer I can handle the fast pace of the Bay Area. People are in a rush and they don’t even know what they are in a rush for.” One of the new grievances was the “Avenue” he lives on that he jokingly calls “an expressway.” The sound of constant vehicle traffic is definitely a contrast to an area previously filled with orchards.""

"Consider this post: ""I used to be a very touchy feely person pre trauma, hell I'd have stood out in a big city with a sign for free hugs, I *wanted* to.

Anyway, over the course of our relationship my bf would still bring Sally up occasionally, how they were going to hang out with other coworkers.

We are typically very understaffed to be able to work in new items, recover the floor and excute the GM’s planned item moves for the day, so after we delegate the managers become stockers and work alongside the hourly employees to get done. I don’t mind physical labor and hard work, it’s actually my favorite part of my job, but it’s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200,000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking.

As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment, but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him, and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment, though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).""

Anyway, when I was 16 I started writing fanfiction about him based on the very imaginative music videos he had starred in for his songs.

I started masturbating at a young age and I wonder if this is linked in. I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.""

But from the beginning of this anxiety my breathing got messed up. Like I was alternating my breathing between hyperventilation and shallow breathing through out the day for all these years. During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like  bone tb or stomach gastritis.

None of us really have family to ask because of different reasons (SO's parents disowned her, Roommate's mom is distant and disapproving and an alcoholi, my mother is disabled and lives on disability with my 13 yo brother, my aunts etc are all stingy or distant).

If it is unconscious, well I am getting sick of that idea."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses a desire to be told negative things about themselves and acknowledges that this is likely self-punishment. They also mention feeling better when people are kind to them, indicating a need for validation and approval.

"Consider this post: ""Obviously this was a horrible idea--I would chase off perfectly lovely people who may have stayed had I waited to disclose at a more natural pace, and it gave the people who *did* hang around a false sense that they knew me more intimately than  they did. I've started seeing someone recently. I haven't been excited about someone in a long time, but I'm excited about this one. I've mentioned very vaguely that I live with PTSD and ""blah blah childhood trauma, et cetera"". This weekend was a tough one.""

He is convinced he needs to stick around, avoid change, see this through, that eventually she’ll “go back to how she was before” (whatever that means) and that he’ll keep trying to make it work. The typical “I can fix this” response that colours victims of abusive partners - and having been one, it is especially demoralizing to see him having to go through this for the sake of avoiding both change and a failed marriage. What can I do to help him, besides support him emotionally, and eventually have him realize for himself that this is not normal? tl;dr: my [25F] partner [30M] is being abused by his wife [28F], but is convinced to keep trying to make it work despite the situation detrimentally affecting his own mental health.""

All of the other kids didn’t know whether to cry with him or look on in horror at the situation."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is describing a traumatic and distressing situation, including witnessing a child crying about his dead mother. However, while this situation is undeniably stressful and distressing, it does not necessarily indicate that the poster themselves is suffering from ongoing stress.

"Consider this post: ""The first is my girlfriend of around 9 months. She doesn't really like her current living situation and suggested we look together. The positives here are that we get along pretty well as far as my relationships have gone, and it would save me money, probably around $5-600 a month. That's not insignificant.

Part of that is because there's no protective trees in the winter, with the other problem being the buildings are run down, and there's lots of cracks around the door. My husband was able to fix a gaping crack with our door frame, but we still need more work done and management is not the best. Our heaters are old baseboard heaters that can heat the home, but run up our electricity bill like crazy.

I  drink nearly all I have and only saving a little to keep the mouth moist after a smoke and I find that by doing so I stay hydrated, never feeling like crap because the water hadn’t finished absorbing into my system.

She is my first girlfriend, but I'm afraid to throw away a relationship that's caused me to love someone so dearly.

"Consider this post: ""I have so much stress over money on a daily basis that sometimes it’s nearly unbearable. As I mentioned, I have received some emergency assistance in the form of loans through /r/borrow, for which I am beyond grateful.

Finally, we are here at the present day. It’s been 2 years since we broke up. My ex still hates me with a burning passion, but I have learned to ignore it and have mostly moved on from the experience.

The first time was when we planned a day out shopping with a mutual friend who was single at the time and my bf decided to invite Sally.

For some background, I recognize that I tend to overreact to normal things, I have panic attacks when people innocently flirt with me for example, and I’ve flown off the handle when too many men have even just looked at me in too short of a space of time. Anyway, so we were roommates in a super tiny apartment that didn’t even have a living room, just our two bedrooms divided by a kitchen. He was having some issues with his ex-girlfriend so he was venting to me for hours about it, and I was trying to give him as much advice as I could, because he’s my friend and I care about him. I told him this and he said he cares about me too, and then he started telling me that when he first met me, he was attracted to me but that I was too young so he felt weird.""

"Consider this post: ""I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on. Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person! I'm seeing someone about these problems but I just thought I'd ask if anyone has any extra advice they could give if things start to get a bit out of control.""

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of frustration and being trapped due to not being able to drive.

We paid out of pocket for a home birth with a backup hospital plan at her parents’ house. The birth was precipitous (very fast, only a few hours) and extremely traumatic and painful. No pain medication, and I think the speed of the birth makes it more traumatic, and our son had his hand over his head when he came out.""

My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses, and he can't have any communication with my mom either. Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm.

Randomly throughout the day, I will notice that it feels harder to breathe and I take deeper breaths than normal. Air coming in almost feels like it has viscosity to it, like molasses, which makes me cough. Most of the time, I don't cough up anything so it's dry."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes experiencing difficulty breathing and a sensation of the air feeling thicker, which causes coughing. These symptoms have been ongoing for two weeks and the poster describes them as both terrifying and annoying. These symptoms and emotions suggest that the poster may be suffering from stress and anxiety, as ongoing physical symptoms can often be a response to chronic stress."
"Consider this post: ""I've heard it's less activating and more calming than Zoloft, as it's the most serotonin selective. I've also heard Trazodone may be an option, for someone who wants SSRI-like-effects without any activation. Additionally, my Psych doctor mentioned Gabapentin as a way to directly target anxiety without any of the long-term concerns of daily benzo use. (though I've read it's not without its own drawbacks.) Obviously, this wouldn't have any serotonergic effect, but could be a good alternative to the Xanax."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is discussing different medication options for anxiety and stress, indicating that they may be seeking advice or information. While the topic itself is related to stress, there is no indication in the language or emotions expressed that the poster is personally experiencing ongoing stress. The tone of the post is more objective and informational, rather than reflecting a personal emotional state. Therefore, the poster does not appear to be suffering from stress based on this post alone."
"Consider this post: ""I got connected with the DV shelter in town to connect to my Crime Victim funds so I don't have to worry about therapy co-pays and I'm filled to the brim with anxiety about class tomorrow. I'm so tired of this. I hate that he probably witnessed me plunging into a panic attack. I hate that he saw that side of me. I don't want to look weak in front of him."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of anxiety, exhaustion, and self-consciousness about their panic attack in front of someone they do not want to appear weak in front of.

"Consider this post: ""I've stopped telling it,  and when someone at work says what's wrong. I just look at them and say its been a day. I just can't really go out and do stuff. I keep pushing college back I wanted to be a nurse and now I don't want to do anything but be a hermit and go live in the woods. I'm not really looking for responses I'm just tired of people not listening or believing me, I've had it all my life and I'm just done with it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of frustration, exhaustion, and a desire to withdraw from social interactions. They talk about not wanting to do anything and wanting to be a hermit, which suggests a lack of motivation and a preference for isolation.

These statements and emotions are consistent with symptoms of stress and suggest that the poster is likely suffering from ongoing stress."
"Consider this post: ""... My husband is an injured veteran. He was pretty seriously injured in Iraq and then again in Afghanistan (muscle tear and then a spinal injury.)

Joe came back, frankly Joe spent ~ a year asking me to go out with him and my gut did not agree, it just felt off, now don’t get me wrong I have loved Joe since I was 17 but I just felt like this wouldn’t be right. I asked Joe for a year, I studied far away, and it was my last year at uni, I asked Joe to give me that year. But Joe said Nah. Joe gave the whole I have changed speech which every girl has probably heard a gazillion times in her life, but still thinks its novel.""

Reasoning: The poster expresses some frustration and disappointment with Joe, but there is no indication of ongoing emotional distress or anxiety.

"Consider this post: ""I’m so mad. Since April I spoke with four professors: all for course evaluations and two for letters of Rec. They all agreed and I send them the necessary documents.

I apply for a masters in a month and have no letters, despite having periodically emailed to update these professors.""

Now that I texted him, that I opened that door again."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

"Consider this post: ""Physical abuse wise my dad had beat me several times, I never really understood that it was abuse until not that long ago, things like hitting my legs together what seemed like as hard as he could, hitting me on the face as hard as he could, threatening to choke me out, etc. it overall made me feel pretty disassociated, I just didn't really understand why though, my relationship with my parents became this extremely hollow thing that felt like an obligation rather than having genuine parents. as I got older from 10 on they became increasingly mentally abusive on top of it, at age 11 my dad found out that I'm trans by looking on my computer and screamed at me for an hour and threatened to hospitalize me (He didnt know mental hospitals wont hospitalize people for it, and might've ended up trying to put me into conversion therapy or something) this is around where my mental health completely snapped, going into 7th grade, hitting age 12, I started becoming extremely suicidal, I thought about hanging myself at school or stabbing myself, it became too much to bear, not being able to be openly trans, being beaten, feeling on edge non stop, feeling completely invalidated to the core of who I am as a person. I became morbidly depressed and stayed that way from then on."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in this post reflects a high level of emotional distress and trauma. The poster describes physical and mental abuse from their parent, as well as feelings of disassociation, hollowness, and being invalidated as a person.

"Consider this post: ""Anyway, long story short, he came over, we had a blast, we had dinner, watched a movie, cuddled, and he fell asleep on me. Four nights later the same thing happened :-) On our second date he told me he had anxiety issues and I just tried to listen to him. He's Spanish so English is his second language, which probably doesn't help his anxiety when talking to an American. Last night he came over and he told me had anxiety and depression issues and he's seeing a doctor."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions that the person they are dating has anxiety and depression issues and is seeking help from a doctor.

"Consider this post: ""Sunday (the 5th) she went outside to drink her margarita, and our 4 year old followed her (she'd been ignoring us all day). I went to help my 5 year old when she called me into the bathroom. A few minutes later, I head up to check on them, and I'm attacked with the accusation that I've locked them out of the house, that i""m crazy, how could I do this? Etc. The front door sticks, for what it's worth."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is sharing a frustrating and concerning incident involving their partner and children. While the situation may have been stressful in the moment, there is no indication that the poster is suffering from ongoing stress.

"Consider this post: ""The first six months I had her she lived in a cage that could have fit two rats, the next year and a half she lived in a cage that could have fit four rats (this is following the formula where you multiply the dimensions of the cage in inches and divide it by 3456. The result tells you how many rats you can comfortably have in one cage.) I loved buying her new toys and treats and seeing how she took them. Trying new foods on her was one of my favorite things to do. The only issue is that I didn't really let her out of the cage much."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a situation where they had a pet hamster and provided it with toys, treats, and new foods. However, they acknowledge that they didn't let the hamster out of the cage much. While this may not be ideal for the hamster's well-being, there is no indication of emotional distress or stress being expressed in the post. The poster seems more focused on sharing their experience of taking care of the hamster rather than expressing personal stress or anxiety."
"Consider this post: ""Each insult he roared, each that lie he told, and each bone that he almost broke became a brick of foundation boosting her will. She greatly missed the boy she fell in love with, but after years of torment and suffering she grew sick of her own lies. She hated the person she had become, and she was shocked to learn the number of years she wasted on him. So on an insignificant, sweltering day in July, she broke free of that little world they created, and finally rejoined the real one. Edit: typo"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The language used in this post suggests that the poster has gone through a difficult and abusive relationship. However, the tone of the post is one of empowerment and liberation.

"Consider this post: ""First post here, using a throwaway because for some reason I just don't want my regular reddit account attached, despite being fairly open about the fact I was raped. But I digress. In February of this year, I was raped by my (now ex) boyfriend, who also happened to be the only person I've ever had sex with. I was diagnosed with PTSD in September. The rape has flipped my life entirely upside down, and there isn't an hour that goes by where my mind doesn't screw me over with either thoughts of the rape itself or simply just HIM.""

"Consider this post: ""This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like ""what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him"" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him. I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel. Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking. This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it. I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

I don't mind the Europe part, but I have zero interest in working for the government and am absolutely shit at economics and I've told him so. No matter how many times I express my lack of interest, qualification, or skill at economics, he ignores me and continues to push this path. It wasn't like this was something he's pushed on me my whole life - it's like he came up with this plan for me when I  turned 18, and now is obsessed with it. I really don't know what to do."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses frustration and helplessness in this post. They clearly state that they have zero interest and lack skill in economics and have expressed this to someone, possibly a parent or guardian, who continues to push them into this specific career path. The poster feels ignored and feels like this plan was suddenly sprung on them when they turned 18. This situation is causing the poster to feel uncertain and unsure of what to do. Their emotional distress and feelings of being trapped in a path they have no interest in or aptitude for suggest ongoing stress."
"Consider this post: ""I need some advice here. I'm not sure if my insecurities have run wild or if I'm justified in thinking my boyfriend is being out of line. He met this girl through friends who set them up and for their first date they went jogging. Weird, I know, but it's her hobby and he wanted to get into it. They'd never met before this."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates uncertainty and indecisiveness.

But the fact that I am doing more self evaluation and healing now than I have in years of therapy or whatever medication they said would make me “better” is incredible. Discuss?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster's language does not indicate a high level of emotional distress or anxiety.

This isn’t anything I’ve actually experienced before (hell, I still don’t get attraction), so I’m confused. My issue is, he’s going back overseas for uni in a couple of days, and we’ll be seeing each other (in our larger group) tomorrow. Should I bring something up? Should I just leave it?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

I think some of the resources are good but I just mean the forum. I'm scared to post this here but I don't know where else would be good to ask so I'm taking the risk. It's just that they both seem to be such prominent forums for vulnerable people. So I just wanted to know if anyone else had similar thoughts about them?""

"Consider this post: ""For the rest of the 7 years, I’ve received different forms of violent punishments. I don’t want to get into it but they involved sharp objects, attempts to drown me, paddling, etc. I was generally OK growing up, didn’t think about the abuse a lot, but friends started noticing strange behaviors and phobias that I cannot hide. Now at 30 years old I went to a therapist. I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because it’s as if I’m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes experiencing violent punishments for seven years, which is a clear indication of a traumatic and abusive experience. The poster also mentions suppressing their memories and struggling with strange behaviors and phobias, which are common symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

"Consider this post: ""But my brain defaulted into my stoned embarrassment. Just having this idea people hate me when they don’t, missing my dad and punishing myself for not being able to help my dad through his alcoholism. Not that he deserves it.

Nothing."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses a sense of hopelessness and despair in their post. They mention not having a bus pass or any resources, and they are unable to find homeless shelters specifically for women.

"Consider this post: ""He purposely said the most hurtful things to me during our break up to make himself feel better. And one of the worst things of all, like I mentioned earlier, he sexually assaulted and that also happened when he knew we were breaking up. Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together. I just want to stop myself from thinking this way and fully move on and have myself realize I am so much better off, and I even try to remind myself of all the bad things he has done but it seems that lingering thought of, ""Well, was it ever that bad?"" keeps returning.""

They describe the hurtful things said during the breakup, the sexual assault, and the potential diagnosis of their ex-partner as a narcissist or sociopath.

"Consider this post: ""Three months of this and talking with the one friend whom I could call for free between 9pm and 6AM due to AT&T's GoPhone policies whenever I could get away with it, or texting on a Nokia Tracphone (the ancient indestructible brick phone), and my sister lashing out at me about being ungrateful that they allowed me to come over and use the internet, triggered by my snapping back due to, something, I can't remember, and I just, stopped asking.

Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I’m off. Even when I’m off, I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though I’m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like there’s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don’t do MORE because I’m normally too tired to do anything else."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster indicates that they have a busy and productive lifestyle, consistently taking care of responsibilities such as exercising, maintaining their living space, and spending time with friends.

I compliment my mom and my sister as much as I can, I tell my sister I’m proud of her, I tell both of them I love them, I take care of my mom the best I can, but I’m still their verbal punching bag. Every day I tell my mom that I love her, that she looks pretty, etc etc, but it ends up in her replying with “you’re gonna fail this year you know that right? You need to do your school work”. My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of people’s interests and looks."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses feelings of shame and a need for support from their boyfriend. They describe their boyfriend as naturally good at keeping them calm, indicating that they rely on him for emotional support.

It’s gotten to the point that if I walk into a room, she’ll leave straight away, and if she doesn’t leave, or if I start talking to her or someone else, she sighs a lot so I know my presence is not wanted. If I’m in her general direction of travel, she’ll be sure to make a wide berth around me, and the only time she’s spoken a full sentence to me was to say “thanks for my present” that I got her for Christmas. Then we get to tonight. Eva and one of my brothers are staying over at our cousins house."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

I remember being in a car seat, my mother didn't know what to do so she took me to him (my parents are apart), and i tried to run because i knew what was going to happen, and i remember crying so hard i hyperventilated, my mom promised never to do that again. He'd do it because of grades, because i misbehaved."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post describes a traumatic and abusive childhood experience. The poster mentions consistent mental and physical abuse from their father, specifically related to school issues.

Should I say I only see her as a friend but nothing greater than that?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster does not express any strong emotions or distress in this post. They are seeking advice on how to word a break-up letter, but the tone is relatively calm and rational.

"Consider this post: ""Here's a homebaked metaphor. This is only a reflection of my personal views, and is not designed to reflect anybody else's experience. ----- Just as witches and wizards in the novels avoid mentioning Voldemort's name, those who have experienced a trauma tend to avoid remembering it, thinking about it, speaking about it, anything that triggers the awful feelings and sensations which a traumatic event conditions us to associate with it. We go to great lengths to avoid doing or saying anything which will activate the trauma."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

I did not think much of it, but noticed that over the course of a couple weeks, he was constantly getting snapchats from Jessica, but was reluctant to open them in front of me. That was another thing that surprised me because he always would open things in front of me, and never had a problem with me on his phone. If he did open a snapchat from Jessica, he kind of pulled his phone closer to him so I couldn't see his screen. I noticed his phone background one day, and saw that it was a happy birthday card with a picture drawn on it, signed from Jessica.""

"Consider this post: ""In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates that the poster is experiencing emotional distress and frustration. They describe the situation as causing them to 'freak out', suggesting a high level of anxiety. Additionally, the poster is trying to understand and make sense of the actions and motivations of the person they are referring to. This level of analysis and concern suggests that the situation is causing them ongoing stress and emotional turmoil.

Then they joked around about how I reacted and that they were my biological dads magazines and i should get mad at him for it. ( No older than 14) My stepdad told my mom (this is what she says) that I wanted a massage, i was sleeping on the couch and my mom for whatever reason got freaked out and ran out of the room naked to see what was going on. And she says that he saw her and stopped walking towards me (13) my mom did ask me if anything happened on the way to school"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

"Consider this post: ""I thought we had an open door, honestly policy about our hook ups, but last week found out he'd made out with a few people during our relationship that I didn't know about. I got hit by a wave of how incompatible we are and tried to break up with him but I realised I was being a hypocrite and letting my insecurities control me and I mended things. ANYWAY, onto the issue. I had a pretty scary time with a friend of mine last night. He invited me around for a few beers, and maybe two drinks in he asked if I'd be down to have sex."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post begins with the poster describing a situation in their relationship where they discovered that their partner had made out with others without their knowledge. This revelation caused the poster to question the compatibility of their relationship and consider breaking up. This indicates emotional distress and insecurity within the relationship.

Then, the poster shares a separate incident where a friend asked them to have sex while they were hanging out. This event is described as a ""scary time"" for the poster. The use of the word ""scary"" suggests a heightened emotional response, potentially due to feeling pressured or uncomfortable in the situation.

Overall, the post portrays a series of stressful events and emotional turmoil for the poster, indicating that they are likely experiencing ongoing stress."
"Consider this post: ""He knows that I'm still on the fence about pot and, without me even asking, promised me that he would not do it. But, last March while he was gone, he got extremely drunk and ended up smoking. He got extremely sick and ended up vomiting and passing out on the bathroom floor of their bus, and called me the next day and told me everything. This was extremely difficult for me to process. I couldn't really understand how something that he swore off doing he just... ended up doing."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses difficulty in processing a betrayal of trust by their partner. They describe feeling conflicted about marijuana and the partner promised not to use it, but then did so when they were away.

"Consider this post: ""The last Sticky thread before this one: <url> There is all kinds of things that friends or therapists say which has helped us, what helps for one person doesn't help for another, but I think it may be helpful if people share what has helped them here. It doesn't have to specifically be related to abuse, it can be advice that helps you in general. I guess what helps me is to remember that any one person can only do their best under the circumstances, not more.""

Reasoning: The post describes a tragic event involving the poster's close family friends being hit by a drunk driver. While the situation is undoubtedly stressful and heartbreaking, the language used in the post is more factual and informative rather than expressing personal emotions or distress.

"Consider this post: ""He told me that I needed to be naked because he wanted to see my “sexy body” he said a lot of sexual things and took off my clothes. I was naked; exposed, lying on his bed on my stomach with my head in a pillow. He flipped me over and sat at the foot of the bed. I put a pillow over my face and at this time it all becomes a blur. He was giving me oral sex, fingering me, and telling me how “hot” I was."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

"Consider this post: ""Long story short: Worked in a call centre for 4 years for a vehicle breakdown service, starting to not be able to cope with it any more due to a combination of things (change in management, not enough staff for a constantly expanding customer base, rewards based on whether your face ""fits"" rather than actual demonstrable achievements, etc). Unable to relax after work, constantly thinking/dreading going to work. Get random mood swings about it, either intensely rageful, or wanting to burst in to tears. Headaches that go on for 3 or 4 days at a time are now a regular occurence. Starting to manifest in other physical ways (unable to sleep, constantly weary, having a lot more sickness than usual)."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster is describing multiple symptoms of stress that are impacting both their work and personal life.

Reasoning: The poster mentions that they have been taking medication and plan to start exercising in order to alleviate their symptoms. While they express frustration and anger, there is no indication of ongoing stress or emotional distress.

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes feeling ill after being on the treadmill, which suggests that they may have experienced some negative physical effects from exercising.

Reasoning: The language used in the post indicates a high level of distress. The poster describes feeling like they are dying, despite knowing that they are not. This hyperbolic statement suggests that the poster is experiencing significant physical discomfort and may be feeling overwhelmed by their symptoms. Additionally, the fact that they clarify that it is an ""actual cold"" and not something they have imagined suggests that they may be prone to health anxiety or excessive worry. These factors together indicate that the poster is likely suffering from stress."
"Consider this post: ""Rarely, I forget about the symptoms. Rarely, they don't bother me, but they still are occurring always. I have seen two different doctors about this. They ruled out a few things and suggested that it was purely anxiety and that I go on an SSRI. I have not gone on an SSRI yet, however I am planning to do so ASAP."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions experiencing symptoms that bother them, even though they forget about them rarely.

When we first hooked up, I had a very successful career in the adult industry and I supported him for almost 2 years before he got a job. He knew what I did before we hooked up because I had been in the industry for years and everyone back home knew. He told me multiple times that he accepted it and he loved me regardless.

"Consider this post: ""I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him. To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him. I almost died twice thanks to him. I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly. I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

He never treated me right, not truly (except maybe in the very beginning), but I never even saw this as a possibility."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes the situation as traumatic and expresses disbelief and shock at the actions of someone they loved and trusted.

"Consider this post: ""He forced me into sex again... And if I refused he became violent. Once I had mentioned to a friend how I hadn't wanted sex and hoped that jacking off would be good enough, and having overheard this my punishment was to be slammed into the wall and the table then thrown to the floor. When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe... I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out, which he never did, and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets. If he felt sober enough, he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards, and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...""

In the past Ive had 3 major ""panic attacks(?)"" where my whole body is in pins and needles and I canʻt breathe well but they were all triggered by major emotional events. I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep.

Shell shocked, I told my mom about it in the car and she made it very clear to me how there was no way in her mind that it could be that serious."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is discussing their past diagnosis of PTSD and their journey towards healing. While they mention experiencing emotional distress and seeking professional help, there is no indication of ongoing stress in this post. The poster acknowledges the validation they received from their therapist but also mentions their mother's disbelief, which may be upsetting, but it does not necessarily indicate ongoing stress.

The post seems more like a casual expression of annoyance rather than a significant source of stress. Therefore, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the poster is suffering from stress based on this post alone."
"Consider this post: ""This is something I'm working on figuring out for myself). Option 2: We each move after we each get a job in City A. Drawbacks: (1) one of us will be left at our current job for a while with our boss and coworkers knowing the other is likely to leave soon after. I'm not sure if this is an inadvisable situation. (2) BF will likely find a job first, as he has a few more years experience than me plus some management experience."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in this post indicates that the poster is currently in a situation where they are trying to figure something out for themselves. However, the mentioning of potential drawbacks, such as being left at their current job while the partner moves, suggests a level of stress and uncertainty.

I actually had one women tell me that my husband's behavior was 'completely normal' and that 'everyone acts like that' (I was floored. I don't know one other person who goes through shit like this at work or who acts like that - WTF?). They just want to brush it off, and no one gives a shit.""

"Consider this post: ""Back in November of 2015, my Junior year of college, I was a hermit socially but had many great and supportive friends (funnily enough were 90% women). However, I was lonely as hell, had never dated, and it was driving me mad and depressing me. I didn't let it show though, except to one or two friends who knew me very well. In the month of november I started hanging out with an organic chemistry study group. Two particular women were part of this group."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions feeling lonely and depressed in the past, but they clarify that they didn't let it show to most of their friends.

Because I made some very bad decisions in the past, my credit is horrible. I have tried to get a loan and it's just not happening. I have no car (no money to get a car, let alone make payments) and payday loans are not offered in AZ. Every online loan option, although bad, seems like a better fate than losing my home of 12 years."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

They mention making bad decisions in the past that have led to poor credit, which indicates feelings of regret or guilt.

Feb 23 weekend, we hung out again, but mostly stayed in because I was tired from traveling for work again.

Everything remained normal up til Feb 26 or so, regular texting, sexy texts, etc."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is describing their weekend activities with their partner and the timeline of events leading up to February 26.

Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the poster is suffering from stress based on this post."
"Consider this post: ""I'm going to try not to sound too sad or victimized, but I'm just sad. I grew up fairly disadvantaged compared to my friends. I've been poor since I was born, never had enough to eat, was abused by my dad, have raised my sister, support my family, work almost constantly, and make money on the side. In addition, I've been consistently abused since I was 8 years old, the same age I met my best friend. She's much wealthier than I am."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is expressing sadness and a difficult upbringing, but there is no indication of ongoing emotional distress or inability to cope with the situation.

"Consider this post: ""I was a friendly person, who enjoyed speaking and interacting with people. I definitely did more than my fair share to help/get things done. And i enjoyed helping people and sharing my knowledge to help novices. Quite extroverted but without being loud.

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a change in their behavior and mindset after an unspecified event. They state that they have become more introverted and less inclined to engage with others.

I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD. I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school. Where/how do I start?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

So 2 minutes into her exploding, she starts crying because apparently her brother told their dad something and the dad called her and said he doesn't trust her anymore or whatever. She was very upset about the dad thing because she's very close with her dad and she's her dads favorite child (he told me that himself when I spoke with him).

I noticed that he had crazy eyes, and he was being very aggressive in speech. He seemed very off to me, and demanded to know why I didn't want to sleep in his bed that night. When I made up the excuse that I had to be up for something early in the morning, he demanded to know what was wrong with our relationship. I kept calmly assuring him that we were fine, and that I just needed rest that night."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

"Consider this post: ""I can't be in an abusive relationship, but I find my brain trying to rationalize this. To expand a little more, this incident happened just a week after we had a huge fight over my depression, which he doesn't seem to understand completely. I've been stuck in a depressive episode for the greater part of a year, despite medication changes and weekly therapy sessions. I've been suicidal for quite some time now and he knows that, but last week he actually told me ""maybe you should just kill yourself."" So, in light of that happening very recently, I'm in a very dark place right now."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is discussing their experience with a diagnosis and medication for their symptoms.

Trigger and Content Warnings**:** Explicit mentions of sex acts with some details,mentions of coercion, mentions of being threatened, mentions of alcoholism.

Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health. I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants.""

"Consider this post: ""Also, stemming from the same background, I am still a virgin (he obviously is not) and I’m not quire sure how I feel about engaging in sexual intercourse with him. Whenever we “talk” about sex, I feel like I’m lying about how I feel. It’s more of an interest in learning the different aspects of sex than actual sexual arousal (I’ve been questioning the possibility of asexuality). If anything, I feel kind of giddy that someone thinks of me in that way but not in the “I want to have sex with you” way. I’m trying to engage him with pictures/videos/etc., but it feels all fake to me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

My trauma occured five years ago, and it doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as it used to (thanks to some tricks I learned on here and through my own research), and I believe I've been handling it all okay.

When I was about 13 I remember thinking to myself that it was crazy that so many of my peers knew what they wanted - I was just really, really confused. I said to myself ""I don't know what I like or which team I go, and I bet that's because of what happened between me and my cousin. I'll figure it out when I'm older"" and that was it.

Reasoning: The poster is describing a situation in which they attempted to comfort and help their sibling, but their sibling did not pursue counseling.

Acid isn’t for all, and I didn’t take it for a fucking therapy session—but, here I am sat down in front of paper and pastels on a wood floor, not thinking about whatever happened to me however long ago.

"Consider this post: ""The only truly good therapist I've been to was in Sweden, she listened, took extensive notes, remembered stuff and didn't talk about herself or her personal life. I need to see a therapist but I don't know what to do. I can't teach my therapists how to do their job nor should I feel like I need to in the first place. I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart. It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

While at school one day, my mom collected some of my belongings and put them in a bag by the door, and then confiscated my house key, telling me I had to leave by the next morning.

I am seeing a therapist for my anxiety, and the next time I have a session I’m going to bring get up everything I talked about here and maybe get some help in dealing with it.

"Consider this post: ""It's also frustrating because I'm finally getting the kind of help I would expect from family and BEYOND from a woman I met while panhandling this summer. Thanks to a stranger: I've been able to finally get mental health assistance, I got my benefits fixed, I got a job, and I have a safe place to sleep out of the rain or snow. I have somewhere to leave my pack and bed roll rather than carry it around 24/7. I could probably ask to store that stuff, but it seems so asinine to ask more of this woman and especially so since it's just extra supplies for my dog I don't really need. I can't understand why even the bare minimum is too much to ask of the people who are supposed to care the most."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses frustration and disappointment towards their family for not providing the kind of help they would expect. However, they also mention that they have received significant support from a woman they met while panhandling, who has helped them with mental health assistance, benefits, job, and shelter.

He would see that I defended my mom and since I called the police one time (I found him choking her onto the wall) he stopped hurting her and transitioned into beating me. Now I know you guys may ask why did you continue to allow the abuse with you if you had stopped it with your mother before? Well I have an answer  to that my mother loved my father very much and every time I tried contacting the police she would stop me and I have a lot of love towards my mother and would do anything for her... but anyways back to the present we no longer live with him anymore and we have cut all ties with him except for my brother."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

And 2) I kind of want to tell the most recent guy that him confessing that to me made me uncomfortable, but I don't know if I should or not. I need help because I don't always have the best judgment of what to do and I'm not always the best judge of character.

I *could* get a small storage unit for my belongings while I ""hold out"" around these people, though that'd be less than ideal (and dangerous)... and paying for the unit would cut into the funds I'd need to cover fuel and such getting out and going up North. Hence why I'm trying posting here. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that my friend's car is on the smaller side, which might make a tight squeeze, so if anyone has a larger vehicle, and is able and willing to move me and my stuff from Fort Worth to Fort Wayne, that'd be cool. I'd be able to cover fuel and such (well, so long as it's not a major gas guzzler we're talking about - I've got about $200 for that purpose).""

He doesn't hesitate to show his bad mood/displeasure (which applies to how he is around most people not just me, but I think it's worse when it's about me).

After going home this winter my parents dropped the bombshell on me that they are struggling to pay my tuition. The thing is, although we are not super rich or anything, my fathers work covers 80% of my tuition and housing, the reason that my parents are unable to pay is that my dad is fairly disorganized and let his expenses build up.

How can I talk with my buddy in a polite way about the matter, that when he invites me over I'd prefer it to be bro time without coming across as an asshole or that I'm against his GF as a person which I'm totally not! Again, she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to, I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that.
