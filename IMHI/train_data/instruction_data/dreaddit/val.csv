In the past three days I have felt myself beginning to spiral and today I am feeling very very dark, very disconnected. I am such a low dosage I am wondering if maybe it's just not working and what I thought was it working was actually just reducing the alcohol intake?

She told me she had just gotten out a relationship before we met, and didn't intend to have such strong feelings for me and now she is just scared. I actually ended up really liking her which has been rare for me lately, so this is something i would like to hold on to if at all salvageable. The problem is we barely text (once a week or so), and have not hung out since that party. Is this a case of 'Just not that into you' so she's just trying to be nice?""

After the first few dates we decided to host a party together around the holidays and for some reason after this her interest level dropped severely. Told me it was moving too quickly and she was scared that it was headed toward something she wasn't ready for. I backed off after this, eventually called her a few weeks later (because communication between us had severely slowed down). I attempted to end what we were doing because i could feel she wasn't interested anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster does express some disappointment and confusion about the situation with the person they were dating.

However, the way in which he did it leaves me wondering if he left the door open or not. The reason why he broke up with me is that this coming semester, he will be working/in class for 12 hours a day and he doesn’t want to put me through that, since he won’t have enough time to give me.

I've done things like ubereats but $15 here and there isn't even making a dent in what I need."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress.

To start off, I remember it being the start off 2015 and I was sleeping over at my best friends house who we will call ""J"". Now J and I would always stay up all night when having sleepovers, and this certain night I managed to pull through to 6:30 am 30 minutes after J had fallen asleep, though when I woke up I was in his sisters bed. Now since then up until now, I just assumed that I was literally half asleep and that I was just looking for anywhere comfortable to sleep that wasn't taken in my literally half asleep state of mind (both his sisters had stayed up all night in the living room I've believed up until this moment, also something to keep in mind is that both of us were to young to be consuming alcohol and I have no memory of myself entering their room.""

I think spending time with other people than me is good for her, but she is so afraid of ruining things for others. TL;DR: Girlfriend has anxiety attacks and cancels plans with friends, not all friends are very understanding.

I feel so alone in this, and judged because my resilience activities, running and lifting, make me appear perfectly normal. I’m desperate to overcome these issues, especially given my profession and the need to operate in crowded conditions. Army docs dismiss my problems because I look capable and am a high-achiever despite it all, even questioning whether the incident resulting in my PH “actually happened”. I need someone to believe me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses frustration and a sense of isolation in dealing with the challenges of living with three traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

I guess it's a thing, and I try to accept that, but I don't know how to react, what to do, what to think... I was so happy with her, I just feel overwhelmingly sad and can't help ask myself what a did wrong, what I should do, where this is going.""

One time, I messed up a performance, and when I saw my peers the next day, I had to remove myself from the situation and go to a place where I could be alone. I don't mind public speaking though.""

Usually they start over something like dinner not being done soon enough, or because my mother found the boxed wine my sister smuggled in, or because my mother simply said something that stuck in my sister's craw.""

She said that it counts as arguing and there is no point to ask him that and she built on that and said some other stuff that expressed that I am wrong to feel this way.

My ex-roommate(who had PTSD from fighting in Iraq and BPD) became jealous that I was hanging out with and spending all my time with a man that was not him, he began to hide my prescription anxiety and sleep medication so I would have to spend more time at my apartment and with him. Late summer 2012 I was able to catch him doing a series of illegal things, had him arrested for petty theft and evicted him from the apartment. I spent a couple months more in the apartment and ultimately ended up moving in with the man I had begun to see (he and I have now been together almost 5 years).""

"Consider this post: ""I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made.

I've known this girl since 7th grade, I met my girlfriend in 9th grade when she moved here. I asked her out before my girlfriend and got lowkey denied, but she was too nice to tell me straight up no.

People say that I'm a great person and easily liked but I don't realize sometimes how my expression and tone may come off, and people naturally give me a benefit of a doubt that I'm just passionate.

The awareness has given me a better grasp on things but it feels like an illness now with this new perspective because it comes over me like one.

It felt good knowing I wasn't alone but I still was in the dark and scared. As time went on I met more people who were going through the same thing and it really helped to have some one to talk to who knew what it was like.""

Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

I'm lucky enough to have a few wonderful friends who supported me in various ways while I've been getting situated, but I don't know how to grow my friendships with them now that I have the freedom to.

"Consider this post: ""The police in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky were... decidedly unhelpful. The local citizenry sympathized with my plight in that respect. I had to hitch-hike back to Lexington. The most I've been able to replace ID-wise so far has been my ATM card and my pre-paid card -- I opened up an account at a national chain bank while I was here the past two weeks and my banker here obviously knows who I am -- and the temp labor place I had been working at had a copy of my ID, so I was able to get that information from them as well.""

She’s been remembering some things from her childhood, and, with the help of her therapist, is trying to process and heal. We don’t live in the same area, and when we got together about a month ago, she filled me in on some of those issues. About a week later, she told me that she was taking a break from electronics in order to try to process and heal, and that she and her therapist had been talking about it for a while.

"Consider this post: ""Are there federal or state (IN) laws that govern shelters for shelters that don't accept any federal funds? According to a news story I have found on this shelter they don't accept federal funding, grants or any kind of corporate or foundation funds. There are so many things going on here that don't seem legal, and many more that are totally unethical. I've been here for a month and here's just a couple of the things that are jumping out at me: * Our meds are kept locked up in a cabinet in a room accessible only by staff and ""resident staff"" (which also seems like a HUGE conflict of interest.)""

"Consider this post: ""This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date. I'm just really happy and gay and proud of myself and Stephanie is really cute that is all"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

I delay meeting her and although she said she's fine waiting, she's still completely out of my league, and because I don't want to come off as desperate, I let her message me most of the time. Anyway, after a month we finally meet up, and it goes incredibly well."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress.

"Consider this post: ""Almost too well. She extends our date twice, buys us a drink each, starts a make out session which lasts for 2 hours, calls me hot, and although neither of us had a house free she gave me oral too. Although she said she had a great time - which I replied to - I then waited to respond to her next message, and I don't know if that killed any momentum because I was already very delayed when we first got talking of course. Anyway, despite our great date and a second one lined up when I asked her out a day later, she ended up cancelling on me, and then told me a week later that she got more serious with another guy - which to me only translated as him being hot and me being ugly. They broke things off a week later, and she did ask me out again, but at one stage I annoyed her with a jokey message.""

"Consider this post: ""She said she always had to message first, and she decided to completely blank me when I apologised, and that was that. The first girl to ever express proper interest in me in my life ends up going completely down the drain. I don't know if it was because of my own management of messages or me being unattractive in general, but despite this great date occurring I only feel absolutely awful because of it in the end. Oh, and to rub salt into the wounds I even noticed she unliked my profile picture of all things. Ouch."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster is expressing disappointment and sadness over a failed romantic connection. While they may feel hurt and rejected, there is no indication of severe or ongoing stress.

I must have horrible luck because I experienced two more horrific events while visiting Dar es Salaam...things I won't get into. For now, I take Wellbutrin for the depression, but still feel myself flinching away from people on the street, or am scared I am being followed or watched.

I've been taking lexapro for like 2 weeks or so, and in the past week it has become very difficult to pee, even at home (it sometimes takes a lot of pushing, and my bladder never feels like it's truly empty.). And the more I have to go, the harder it is, so I try to go often, like every 30 mintues or hour or so (even at night). I can barely eat or drink anything anymore.

"Consider this post: ""Hey everyone, I’ve had quite the journey the last couple of years trying to get through a masters program in psychology to be a therapist and also dealing with health concerns. I came upon some research that led me to some conclusions that could possibly help some women who have gone through similar situations. So I was raped when I was 10 years old and gone through other various forms of trauma all throughout my childhood. I functioned pretty well until I got to my graduate program in clinical psychology.
