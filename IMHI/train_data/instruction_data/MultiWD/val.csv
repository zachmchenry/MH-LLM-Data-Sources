"Consider this post: ""I hate every single thing about myself and I don't know how to stop. My looks, my personality, my body, my voice, everything I do makes me hate myself a little more.

"Consider this post: ""I have been depressed for 6 years now. I went to see a therapist and I told my parents and friends about it, around 5 years ago. A year after that, I just accepted my depression and I acted like everything was going great. My parents and everyone else were relieved and I swore that I would never tell anyone about my burden anymore. But it feels good to admit it here. I honestly believed that I deserved all those horrible feelings and lack of happiness, but I have a better self-esteem now and I want to feel better. I'm no longer thinking that I deserve this, no one does actually. I'm considering getting help again but I wonder if a therapist can trust me after faking getting better to another therapist? And should I tell the people around me how I faked getting better?"" Question: Does the social wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: No. The post mainly focuses on the individual's personal journey with depression, including their decision to not share their burden with others and their current consideration of seeking help again. While there is mention of relationships with therapists and loved ones, there is no explicit discussion of the interdependence between individuals, society, and nature, which is the key aspect of the social dimension of wellness according to Dunn's model."

"Consider this post: ""Hello everyone, I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house.

I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed? Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me..."" Question: Does the spiritual wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post.

"Consider this post: ""All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen. This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. It's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Fuck everything.""

"Consider this post: ""I woke up feeling like everything was like off kilter. Sort of like the world was mirrored or I'm looking at everything from a different angle. I don't know how to describe it.

It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't.""

To tell you the truth I don't even know why I am so in love with this woman.

She finally got around to having us exchange divorce paperwork a few months back, and on Jan 12 we'll be having a quick trial for a no-fault divorce. This was never a separation I wanted. I went from marriage counseling directly to weekly individual therapy last year, though I had found it unhelpful and stopped going after a few months. I feel like I annoy my friends when I try to talk to them about this, and there's always stuff going on in the back of my mind about this. I just want out of this mess, but I know in two weeks that even though there may be some legal closure, emotionally I'm not optimistic that things will be final. As a 28 year old guy, I hate that so much time has past and I still feel stuck and like shit. How do I get through this?""

It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago. People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are. People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up. I feel like I've just always been a little gloomy and don't feel very different now compared to before other than the whole bending of time thing. People say they noticed a change in me, but I didn't, maybe they just expect something like that to mess up a 14 year old?""

We met and had coffee this afternoon and we talked and laughed. At the end he hugged and kissed me on the cheek and asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow. I said yes.

I asked him if he could stay with me for a while until I felt better. We went back to my apartment and talked about stuff. I started getting really sad and started to cry. He hugged me and I told me that everything will be okay. I just really wanted love and physical attention at that moment so I kissed him and I climbed on top of him and straddled him and we made out for a while. Why can't I be alone?""

"Consider this post: ""Everything is falling or has fallen apart. My dad killed himself several years ago because my mom left him for some douchebag with money. My dog followed three months later. I got an incurable STD from someone I trusted but shouldn't have. Ive lost my license, and my car. Im trapped in a dead end janitorial job that Ive been maxed out in for the last 3 years. My spare income goes towards weed, so I can keep myself blithe and functional. All I can do is go to work in a few hours and pretend everything is cool. Nothing will ever change. I'll always be poor. I'll always be lonely, I'll always be depressed. The woman I've been talking to is married, and on top of it, I think is close to dumping me for another side guy. I could be imagining that. Things have been different for several weeks. Then since we've gotten closer to the New Year, she distanced herself more and more. I think she's trying to get me to break up with her so she can move on guilt free. I don't know. We barely communicate. It seems like she has better things to do. My intentions are to continue suffering through life, chain smoking, pounding sugar, and eating junk, until I get diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, and let it go untreated to kill me. I have tremendous respect for people who have the balls to kill themselves. Im not strong enough to be one of them. I wonder if I'm even depressed or just too fucking lazy to do anything for myself..? I just don't want to live.""
