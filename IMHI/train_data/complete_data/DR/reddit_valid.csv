"Post: I'm finally dead inside and I don't know how to feel about it Fear, Anger, Sadness... It's all gone. I just feel numb"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post strongly indicates that the poster is suffering from depression. The poster expresses feeling ""dead inside"" and lacking emotional response to fear, anger, and sadness. This emotional numbing is a common symptom of depression. The post reflects a sense of emptiness and the inability to process or experience emotions, which aligns with the clinical criteria for depression."
Post: what's it like coming off anti-depressants? I heard that if you're on them for longer than 3 months it's really difficult. You get brain zaps and all kinds of side affects. Is this true? Can somebody with experience please let me know whats it was like for you?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses concern and curiosity about the experience of coming off anti-depressants. The mention of potential side effects such as ""brain zaps"" indicates a familiarity with the topic and suggests that the poster may have personal experience or know someone who has experienced these symptoms when discontinuing anti-depressants.

This, combined with the overall tone of seeking personal experiences, suggests a potential connection to depression or related mental health issues."
"Post: I really need help making friends I'm 25, living with my parents. I recently quit my job, hoping to ease my depression but it only made it worse since I have nothing to distract me now. I lost touch with all of my high school friends after graduation, and didn't make any friends in college. I spend my days walking my dog, reading wikipedia articles, youtube, etc. I haven't spoken to another person since Monday. I just stay in my room and my parents don't come in. I don't have any hobbies, not even video games so I don't even have ""online"" friends. I have no friends or anybody to talk to. I realize this isn't a healthy lifestyle, and that I'm a loser. But I want to change. How do I meet people and make friends? When I meet people, what do I talk about?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of loneliness, isolation, and self-deprecation. The poster describes lacking social connections, spending most of their time alone, and feeling like a loser. They express a desire for change and seeking advice on how to make friends and engage in conversations. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-criticism, and desperation align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The lack of social interaction, loss of interest in activities, and negative self-perception further support the identification of depression in this post."
"Post: So dramatic 😪 My best friend and I were in the same school ever since we were 4 years old. But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didn’t grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. I’d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :’) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and they’ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and she’s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees that’s she’s changed, but doesn’t want her change to affect our friendship. What do you think we should do?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily focuses on a specific issue regarding a friendship and seeking advice on how to handle the situation. While the post mentions changes in the friend's attitude and expresses concern, it does not convey profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post seems more reflective and seeking solutions rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: My dad's mad after game night. My family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad. Should i say something to him or let it pass?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily focuses on a specific issue within the family dynamic and seeks advice on how to handle the situation. While there is a mention of the father being mad and a lack of communication, there is no indication of profound hopelessness or despair. The tone of the post seems more pragmatic and seeking guidance rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: My goal in life is to finally feel safe I'm at my boyfriends house. Been here a few days. I stay here every so often to escape my unstable home life, and hes all I have. I got a call from my dad. My childhood dog had to be putdown. Bone issues. Everytime I think of anything that gives me anxiety I feel the need to pick at my skin. My face is red and scabbed. I dissapoint everyone because I was the one destined to be smart and be the first (family name) with a degree and stable job. I turn 18 next month. No job experience. I get my photo id next week. Its very late because my parents lost my birth certificate. Set me back a lot. My mum is suddenly rushing for me to get Centrelink (welfare), so she can take half of each payment. We barely have food in the house most days because she uses her welfare on cigs and bills. I feel like I do nothing. Everyday is just nothing. In bed, video games, browsing internet, sex, video games, sad music and alcohol. Rinse and repeat. No joy. I want a social life and a hobby. I want a job. I want to not feel like im just laying down while everything falls apart on top of me. I want to feel safe and happy and like I give back and help people. I dont want to waste my life. I dont know why but I keep feeling like I'm going to die soon. I dont want to but its in my head. I dont want anxiety and i dont want to be pathetic and i dont want to be scared and i dont want to be bored and i dont want people hate me and i want to know what to do"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling unsafe and using their boyfriend's house as an escape from their unstable home life, suggesting an underlying distressing environment. The mention of their childhood dog being put down leads to a physical manifestation of anxiety through skin-picking. The poster expresses disappointment in themselves and feeling like a failure for not living up to their family's expectations of being smart and achieving academic success. They mention turning 18 soon with no job experience and setbacks in obtaining identification documents, adding to their feeling of being stagnant and not progressing in life. The mention of their mother rushing for them to get welfare and the lack of food in the house due to their mother's priorities further contributes to a sense of helplessness and lack of control. The poster describes their daily routine as joyless, engaging in activities such as video games, browsing the internet, and using substances as a means of escape or coping. They express a strong desire for a social life, a hobby, a job, and to feel safe and happy, but feel unable to attain these things. The mention of feeling like they're going to die soon suggests thoughts of hopelessness and potentially even suicidal ideation. The overall tone is one of desperation and a plea for guidance, which aligns with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: 4 years Tuesday Tuesday will be the four year anniversary of when my dad committed suicide. My 21st birthday was this weekend and I got pretty drunk and started to think about it and I just cried and cried in the Uber with my friends. I’m really thankful for them. But there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him. The thing is, he was an asshole. To me and my mom. I didn’t know he was depressed, I just thought he was mean and didn’t love me. I really do think I could’ve prevented it if I’d known. I’ve been extremely depressed ever since it happened. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal again."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep and profound emotional pain related to the anniversary of the poster's father's suicide. The mention of getting drunk and crying, as well as the statement of being extremely depressed since the event, indicates a high level of ongoing emotional distress. The post also includes feelings of guilt and self-blame, suggesting a possible struggle with self-esteem and feelings of responsibility for the father's actions. The statement that the poster does not think they will ever be ""normal"" again implies a long-lasting and debilitating impact on their emotional well-being. These emotions align with the symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Feeling trapped in my head First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless. So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feeling trapped in their head and struggling to remember anything, which can be a symptom of depression impacting cognitive function. They also describe feeling alone, having a sense of pointlessness in life, and valuing others' feelings over their own. The mention of a cycling accident and the resulting memory loss further adds to the emotional distress expressed in the post. Additionally, the poster mentions having made attempts at self-harm and contemplating sharing their struggles with their girlfriend but being afraid of her reaction. The lack of positive memories and the description of seeing gray mist or static when recalling memories further highlight the emotional pain and lack of joy associated with severe depression. Overall, there are strong indicators of profound hopelessness, despair, and self-esteem issues, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Cried in a bathroom stall I'm not the type to post this kind of things, but I hate myself. I try my best to socialize, to be emphatic but I end up here every single time. Alone, boring and fucking depressed. Sometimes I think maybe I should be dead instead of someone else who had way better success at life than I did. I hate feeling this way and I take it out on my family when I can't control it. No matter how hard I try, socially I get nowhere, no friends, no relationships and no happiness. So here I am, if you guys know any sort of assassin hit me up, I might actually pay you to take me out. Save me the trouble of doing it myself. Peace out."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post is filled with intense emotions of self-hatred, despair, and hopelessness. The poster expresses a deep sense of loneliness and feeling like a failure in life. They mention thoughts of wanting to be dead and even considering hiring an assassin to end their own life. These extreme feelings of self-destructive thoughts, lack of social connections, and desire to escape their pain clearly indicate a significant level of emotional distress consistent with symptoms of very severe depression."
"Post: I guess I’m done with her? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? So, in the Literature class, we did a practice exam paper and we had a peer assessment. One of my friend had my paper and it turns out she graded mine the lowest in the class. The teacher was actually surprised on her harsh mark and said jokingly ‘Hey, he (me) did all right. Isn’t that too harsh?. Later I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade. Then, she rants out all the things I’ve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldn’t quite catch all of them. And I became a bit angry at her attitude because 1. She spoke so fast (so I couldn’t quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so I’m startled before I can argue back. 2. Majority of her points were about that I lacked explicit points, but the teacher ticked all the points and said they were explicit enough? So, I said back to her ‘Hey but the teacher said the essay was all right’ She scoffs and says: ‘Yeah, write like that in the real exam and you will totally pass. Who are you kidding?’ Now I wouldn’t really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism, but she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough.. BTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think it’s safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, she’s not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time??? Besides, she really always says rude things in front of someone’s faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and she’s sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical. I guess I’m done with her right? Or is there something wrong with my attitude? I regretted a couple of times being friend with her in the first place, and now I really see that there can be no good staying with her. And, I'm in my final year before graduation... I feel quite embarrassed that I'm complaining about this kind of friendship problem and I know I should be focusing on studying, but thinking about this gets me angry every time."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the poster does express some negative emotions and frustration towards their friend. However, these emotions and concerns are limited to the specific situation with their friend and the impact it has on their academic performance. There is no indication of a prolonged or pervasive sense of hopelessness, despair, or lack of enjoyment in other areas of life. The post primarily focuses on the issue with the friend and seeking validation or advice on whether to end the friendship, rather than expressing broader emotional distress commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Are my friends leaving me out on purpose? This has been bugging me for a while, I mean I've gotten to the point where I've made a Reddit account to vent about it. So I'm on of those girls who has two best friends, I'm sure you can already see where this is headed (I'll call them Susie and Amy). When I started secondary school I didn't have any friends since I had joined out with my school catchment area. Although, I met Susie and she quickly became my best friend. We were in a big group of girls which included Amy. Amy and Susie had become close since they lived near each other and had had lots of sleepovers and days out together and stuff. I had made friends with a girl called Ruby who was Amy's best friend at the time and eventually Amy and Ruby fell out, causing the group to split up and because I was closer to Susie, I went with her. This left Amy, Susie, and I to form a little ""squad"" and the three of us were extremely close for the next three years. Some things happened with Susie which resulted in Amy and I falling out with her for about 10 months. Nothing big, just usual girly bitching and drama. Amy and I became extremely close during this time but something Amy told me really hurt. When we were in the process of making up with Susie, Susie had told Amy that she considered Amy to be the closest person to her. That couldn't be right? I went to Susie's house every Friday? I helped her out with her chores whenever I was over, I stayed over almost every weekend, I went on trips with her and her family all the time, we sat next to each other in almost every class, we constantly texted and called and she wouldn't hesitate to tell me every detail of her life and problems and neither would I. Amy had a job and was always working weekends, she was also never the type to text people or even call since she was always with her sister. So why did Susie consider her closer? It really stung but I got over it. My issue now is that since the three of us have made up I can't help but feel a little excluded. I'll only give one example since everything's of a similar nature. We've been off school for the past three days because of the snow. I saw that Susie was at Amy's house on the first day, I was a little bummed about not being invited but I brushed it off since it could've just been a spontaneous visit. But Susie is at Amy's Mothers house today, I'm assuming she's staying over, and it's not like I live an hour away. I live a 15 minute walk away, it would only take 5 minutes to get a lift there and the snow isn't bad anymore. So...did I do something to warrant not being invited? Usually Amy would always invite me over, we would have loads of sleepovers... And y'know to top it all off, my Grandma passed away on Tuesday, Susie had met my grandma and visited her with me a lot and even though I had told her what happened she messaged me later to ask why I seemed sad, only to act shocked and say she 'never realised' that my grandma had died even though I had already told her. Amy knew my grandma had died too but she hasn't said a word to cheer me up. These girls aren't awkward or unsympathetic either, they've taken care of me when someone has passed away before. Are they being like this on purpose? TL;DR Close friends I've had for years are excluding me, is it on purpose or by accident?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the poster exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The post expresses feelings of insecurity, self-doubt, and hurt over perceived exclusion from friends. The poster feels the need to vent about their concerns on Reddit and questions whether their friends intentionally leave them out. The mention of falling out with one friend, feelings of hurt over not being considered the closest person by another friend, and recent loss of a grandparent adds to the overall emotional distress conveyed in the post. The tone is filled with sadness, confusion, and a sense of isolation, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Religious difference between you and your child? Hi everyone! I am a doctoral student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and am conducting a research study on the experience of religious difference between parents and children.

"Post: Mother is always trying to start something. My mom and I have a rocky relationship, I love my mom but sometimes I absolutely cannot stand her or the things she does. It stems from her depression that she has, but she always blames everything in the world for her problems and never herself. Yesterday, she texted me that my grandparents were moving from our hometown they've lived in since the 80's and to the town where more of our family lives. I sent a picture of my discount card from my job and said they could use it if they needed to buy boxes or moving supplies. She replied with ""That's it no emotion?"" Should I have been more emotional to the situation? I don't blame my grandparents for moving because I moved out of state last year. I don't care what my grandparents decide to do because it's their decision to move. I don't blame them for moving at all."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: Based on the post, the individual expresses frustration and a strained relationship with their mother, which can be emotionally distressing. However, there is no indication of the deep emotional pain, exhaustion, numbness, or lack of enjoyment typically associated with very severe depression. The individual's response to their mother's text displays a lack of emotional connection to the situation, but it does not necessarily suggest depression. Overall, there is not enough evidence in the post to label the poster as suffering from depression."
"Post: This is the nicest group of people on the internet. I would come here everyday even if there wasn't so much helpful advice on here. Especially when I'm having a particularly bad time, when I don't even feel like playing my PS4. Instead of just staring at my game library I open up this subreddit. Makes me feel like I'm not alone. And with everything shitty going on in this world, and all the shitty people around me/us, it's really comforting to see a community online that is being so nice and helpful to each other."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a strong sense of emotional reliance on the online community and expresses the poster's need for support during difficult times. The mention of not feeling like playing their PS4, a typically enjoyable activity, suggests a lack of pleasure and motivation, which can be indicative of depression. The poster also mentions feeling alone and highlights the negativity in the world and the people around them, further indicating a potential depressive mindset. The overall tone of finding comfort, support, and solace in the online community aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: How to end a friendship Hello I have two good friends male (27) and female (27) who are in a relationship with each other. We have been friends for almost 7 years now. 2 years ago, I (26) started dating my current bf (35). During that time, I was playing hard to get, and I was not really interested in my bf at the time so I would talk about him to my male friend who is in the relationship with my other friend. At one point, my friend told me that my bf is a sucker for love because he was chasing a girl that didn't want him...fastfoward...I accidentally told my bf that my friend called him a sucker and my bf said he doesn't want me being friends with him anymore. When my friend and I spoke about my bf, my bf and I were just dating, we were not bf and gf so I don't think my bf should taken it to the extent that I shouldnt be friends with him. Regardless....the point is that idk how to tell my friend that I can't be friends with him anymore...and if I'm not friends with him than his gf, which is my friend too, is not going to be my friends anymore...I feel bad because they are always asking to go out with us but they don't know the arguments I had with my bf regarding this matter. I feel stuck in this situation and I need your assistance. Thanks"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily focuses on a specific dilemma regarding ending a friendship as a result of a conflict between the poster's boyfriend and their male friend.

"Post: Sometimes I worry I let my mental illness be my excuse? It feels easy to justify staying up late, not eating properly... Not going out or not doing xyz; because I'm unwell. It feels impossible to differentiate between me being unwell and me not using it as an excuse. I feel like I know who I am when I'm well and I'm never awake at 5 am or failing a piece of work etc. But do I allow myself to trap myself longer by not trying harder? Letting it be an excuse? I've no way to tell really. I think I've been depressed so long now that I can't even remember what normal is. Or tell if my changes in character are related to being unwell or to me changing. If anyone wants to chat at all I'd enjoy that."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses worries and doubts about using mental illness as an excuse for certain behaviors or failures. The poster questions their own ability to differentiate between their mental illness and personal responsibility, suggesting a loss of self-identity and confusion. They also mention feeling trapped and unsure about whether they are trying hard enough.

"Post: dropped back into a depression, feels like i️ travelled back in time anyone else feel like this? about this time a year ago i️ went through a very rough patch due to depression, and it was one of the lowest points in my life. i️ slowly but surely started to get better, or rather, more numb. eventually i️ was ok. not happy, but i️ could function fine. fast forward to today and i️ suddenly dropped back into my depressed mindset. it’s as though i️ just woke up from a year long sleep, like i’d been going through some fugue state. it’s weird and scary but also familiar and comfortable in the worst ways. i️ feel so awful but life also feels more real than it has in the past year. i️m suddenly remembering all of my regrets and aspirations and relationships that i️ had just pushed down and suppressed and it’s awful but also it feels like i’ve found a missing part of myself? this is ramble-y and i️ don’t know if it makes any sense but i️ just wanted to put it out there."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of emotional pain and despair, describing the feeling of traveling back in time to a previous period of severe depression. The poster mentions going through a rough patch and experiencing one of the lowest points in their life due to depression a year ago. They describe gradually getting better but becoming more numb, indicating a temporary improvement in their emotional state. However, the post then describes suddenly dropping back into a depressed mindset, feeling awful but also more aware of their regrets, aspirations, and relationships that they had previously pushed down and suppressed. This suggests a relapse into depression and a feeling of overwhelming emotional distress. The overall tone of the post aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly the intense feelings of sadness, fear, and discomfort."
"Post: Finding it difficult after college Hi. Im 23 and lately I've lost interest in everything. It kinda started last semester, I finished my masters and missed out on a 1.1 from a bad assignment, can't find any jobs relating to my degree and am currently stuck in a miserable retail job. Since the new year started everything has been getting tougher. I've been applying for PhDs, science jobs and anything that i could use my degree for, and everything Ive applied for I've been rejected from. My supervisor I was applying for scholarships with has kinda just abandoned me because I was declined from a competitive scholarship he wanted his project funded for. I feel like everything relates back that I narrowly missed out on my top grade so I'm basically an idiot. Since then I'm in a retail job where I get shouted at by customers every day. My roommate and best friend landed me saying she was leaving our apartment and ringing the landlord-literally out of nowhere-, so I've to leave the city and move back home. I've been prescribed antidepressants before but I found that they made me feel worse and I couldn't stay on them. I feel like I'm just stuck in a rut and I'll never get out. All my friends are either in phds or jobs that they like and I'm the only one in a miserable job. I've applied for another masters, the one I initially wanted before I got accepted into the one I degreed in, but I feel like it's just a waste of time. I have a family that loves me and a boyfriend and a few good friends I know care but I just find myself thinking that theyd be happier if I wasn't around. Everything I've tried to do has just been a failure and I've just lost interest in life. Some days I really don't want to leave my bed and just lie there because I'm just going to fail again. Sorry for the rant.

"Post: I am so fucking unbearably lonely I have no job, no friends. and nothing even close to an SO. I've never even been on a date.

I married my current husband on Sept 1, 2017. On 10/6/17 he lost his job. Now I feel as if I'm back where I started. I have to pay for everything. On top of it, he invited his 18-year-old daughter to move in with us without asking me, even though I'm paying for everything. Suddenly I'm paying for her groceries and everything else on top of his. Then, I'm informed by my husband that his daughter's boyfriend is going to spend every weekend here: Friday night through Sunday afternoon. Now I'm feeding him too. To make matters worse, the daughter and her boyfriend are loud and inconsiderate. They leave messes in the kitchen, living room, her room, etc. I miss my quiet house. Paying for him and I is more than enough. Am I selfish to not want to support her and her boyfriend too? I have a house in a different city but he refused to move there because my young adult kids live there.

Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life.

"Post: I will never be able to take care of myself, let alone anyone else. I physically can't find the energy to even do the most basic things, like laundry, showering, and eating. Grocery shopping is a really tiring adventure that is followed by a four hour nap. My schoolwork to rest ratio is 1:10. I can't even remember to water the singular plant that I own. They always end up dying before I even realize. I don't even know how I'd be able to take care of a pet, let alone any kids. It's a really good thing I don't want kids, because I'd be a terrible, neglectful mother. I'd hardly have any energy to make them food, let alone entertain them.

"Post: Advice please. Am I in the wrong or is she overreacting? This is going to be a long post! This is my very first post! Me (F33) and, now ex best friend (F33) just had a major falling out and she’s blaming me. Here’s a little backstory; We were best friends, did everything together, babysat each others kids and just hung out all the time. I have 5 kids, she has 2. My youngest are 19 month twins, her youngest is 9 month old girl. I babysat last for her on Nov 1st. Before dropping her baby off, I always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor. Nothing dangerous in her reach (obviously, I Baby proofed for my kids). She was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something I didn’t see and, like babies do, she stuck it in her mouth. I went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but I couldn’t get it and it made her gag; not choke, gag. So I angled her down, patted her back and it fell out. She smiled at me when I turned her right side up, obviously unfazed by what just happened. I stayed calm, and did what needed to be done, no harm. Told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after. Thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago. She sends me a text; that’s right, a text, and basically tells me that I can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house should’ve been a red flag. (My house is lived in, not a pig sty). She said I dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she could’ve choked. Also, I was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means I was lazy and didn’t see it as a big deal. News flash- it wasn’t a big deal, nothing happened. She said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over. I’m sorry but if it’s safe enough for my twins it’s safe enough for her daughter. She found something that I couldn’t see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth. I stayed calm, responded and everything was fine. Should I apologize? Did I do something wrong? She is refusing to talk to me face to face. I don’t feel like I should apologize for something every baby does. I just can’t believe she held onto this for so long. We’ve even hung out since then and she never said anything. Just some advice please."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Does Trading Help Your Depression? Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my ""true"" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah. When I mean trading I mean medium term investing based on value investing. IDK if the risk and reward part overruns me, but when I think about that I don't think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks, I focus on kicking ass and taking names.

Lately, I've just been having a tough time, especially since it's the last week before exams in my school. I don't feel any pressure to be doing well at studies anymore, but I do have one friend who *does,* and occasionally, he'll ask for space or something during stressful times so that he doesn't end up lashing out at me, but now, it's just making me feel incredibly lonely. I hate having to watch everyone else give hugs and stuff and just have a good time with their friends while I just keep having to give my friend space. I get that we put this in place to avoid having feelings hurt, but now it just feels... restrictive? It's all kind of hard to describe coherently, and my mind feels all jumbled up, tbh.

I went to my mom’s house and when I got there, there were guests staying over that I didn’t know. I have very severe social anxiety so this is not good. When I called my mom before driving to her house, she specifically said that no guests were over and it was okay to come. She lied. I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I wasn’t going to come over if there were guests there. I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of “fuck your social anxiety, do what I want” I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I couldn’t handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I can’t take deal with my social anxiety. She says she doesn’t believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, I’ve spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she doesn’t leave. At this point I don’t know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. She’s not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep. I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I can’t drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it. Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I don’t respond to the question because I don’t want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby. She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I didn’t lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and “forget about my anxiety”. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that I’m being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this.

Now foremost, I’m fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings it’s how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no it’s her expensive kind. I’m not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff it’s just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point I’m getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again I’m an adult and can buy myself things but she can’t spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card. If I can’t afford a gift, she makes damn sure my bday co es and goes without her buying bday gift. Immature or not I’m very hurt by this. I was always a good kid, never in trouble, finished high school, went to some college and never asked for hand outs. Why am I not worth two small sprays of designer perfume??"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits a strong sense of emotional distress, specifically related to the poster's relationship with their mother and the differential treatment they receive compared to their siblings. The poster describes being disregarded, treated as less than, and consistently having to provide for themselves while their siblings receive preferential treatment. The mention of feeling hurt, not feeling good enough, and questioning their worth indicates a significant level of emotional pain and potentially low self-esteem. While there is no mention of physical symptoms or other mental health indicators, the overall tone and content of the post suggest that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression."
"Post: Am I Depressed or is it something else? This seems like a dumb question because to an extent I know I'm depressed but not to a clinical level. Like I hate the situation I'm in. I hate being in debt. I hate living where I live. That sort of thing. However, I'm not unmotivated. Like at all. I'm not hopeless. I'm not suicidal in any way. I'm terrified of death in fact one of my biggest fears is that I'll get so depressed that I'll become suicidal which is weird, I know but the point is, nothing in me wants to die. That being said, I'm tired all the time. I mean physically exhausted. Which seems to contradict major depression. I get up every day, shower every day, though I don't really want to go to work I go to work and do work with no issue (it's more that I don't enjoy my job that much on most days honestly some days it's super fun it's just one of those things it really has to do with the fact that I'm older and I'm not doing what I thought I'd be doing by this point in my life more than I hate my job). I can't think of many reasons why I'd be this physically exhausted all the time. Literally every doctor says ""You you are just massively depressed"". No, I don't believe I'm depressed to the degree that it makes me physically exhausted. If I still have plenty of hope for the future, want to get up, want to get dressed, want to shower, want to look good...how is this major depression to a point where I'm also tired all the time? Is it possible to have some major depressive disorder and not be hopeless and still be motivated to work hard and try new things? Because if it is, someone needs to tell me that. Any time a doctor tells me I must be depressed if I'm so tired all the time and I tell them that I'm not hopeless or suicidal or unmotivated then they go, ""Oh well I don't know what it is then"". I'm very annoyed with this because I never used to be physically exhausted like this before and doctors seem to just dismiss it as depression when I'm positive my depression isn't so bad it's ONLY making my physically exhausted and not having any other emotional affect on me. I'm frustrated so, if anyone can answer this it'd be helpful so I can see what avenue to pursue next. Note: It's not a problem with my thyroid or adrenal gland I already had those checked twice by two different doctors."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing a range of symptoms that align with major depressive disorder. They express feelings of exhaustion and physical fatigue, even though they still have motivation and hope for the future. This suggests a discrepancy between their emotional state and physical symptoms, which can be indicative of depression. The poster also mentions frustration with doctors dismissing their concerns and attributing their exhaustion solely to depression. This frustration and sense of not being understood or validated is a common experience for individuals with depression. Overall, the post provides evidence of depressive symptoms and the impact it has on the poster's daily life."
"Post: Do therapy sessions work? I’m 18F, I’m really unhappy with existing. I constantly feel low, I have no social life or friends, even when I did - I had no interest in going out. I’ve recently gone through a breakup and it’s made everything worse, my heart feels like it can’t take no more. And I’ve got classes everyday which I don’t want to do. I’m just sticking in it for the last 6 months. I don’t feel any joy anymore, should I see a GP? Do therapy sessions work? I don’t see what they could tell me that I already know, exercise, go out and do things - talk about how I’m feeling. I’m pretty self aware. What are things you’ve done that have worked?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of unhappiness, low mood, and lack of interest in activities. The poster describes feeling constantly low, having no social life or friends, and experiencing worsening emotional distress after a recent breakup. The mention of feeling like their heart can't take anymore suggests extreme emotional pain. The mention of classes they don't want to attend and feeling no joy anymore indicates a significant lack of motivation and pleasure. The poster expresses uncertainty about the effectiveness of therapy sessions and seeks advice on what has worked for others. The overall tone reflects a sense of hopelessness, despair, and a desire for change, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I love life, but having to work and waste my life makes me suicidal. I just dont understand, i tell people the way i feel and they say shit like ""well you have the weekend at least"" AT LEAST?! what the fuck. my life is being drained away one day at a time, i have all these hobbies and interests that make life worth it and i just dont get to enjoy them instead i just sit inside at a desk all day doing things i hate. I spoken to therapists and friends, and anyone i can. I just dont know what to do, no matter what i have to work. its just the way it is. but every single day i wake up and think why stick around, why be here doing things i hate 90% of the time just so i can complain about not getting a life for the other 10%. I just cant believe people are okay going into work everyday. its like being pecked to death by a duck. I have all these things i love, that make me happy and i just dont get to do them, and everyone acts fucking beffudeled that i feel this way. i do not get to have a life. no one does. we work for other people who are working for other people and it goes all the way up like that untill you get to the donald trumps of the world who where born with a silver spoon shoved sideways up there ass. How can people feel okay about this. ive taken drugs ive worked out everyday ive followed all the advice but it just doesnt change reality. I dont even know why im posting ill just get the same ""try going back to college"" bullshit, i know exactly what i want, it is simply unobtainable."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of despair, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. The poster describes feeling drained by the necessity of work and despising their current job, which leads to a constant feeling of dissatisfaction and lack of fulfillment. They express frustration and sadness about not being able to pursue their passions and interests, and having to spend the majority of their time doing something they hate. The mention of seeking help from therapists and friends, as well as trying different strategies like drugs and exercise, indicates a persistent struggle with their emotional state. The overall tone of despair, anger, and resignation suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Found out my mother has issues. What should I do? I know it was wrong but I had a gut feeling to check her messages today when I was helping her with something on her phone. I snooped and saw that my mother has been messaging this man (I do know of him as he helped my family in a business transaction 1 year ago). She has been messaging him for a few months almost every other night. It dates back to a year ago but it only started looking obsessive (every other day) from approximately 5 months ago. He has not been replying her. If it's a reply, its extremely rare. It's constant double blue ticks (means he read the message) on whatsapp. What should I do? I'm not sure if my mum realises that this is a creepy act or that she's bothering him because he hasn't said a single word or that she's doing it cause she's lonely and confused. My mum is 55+ and she's been divorced for 19 years now. I'm really not sure what to do or how to react to this situation as it totally caught me offguard. Please help."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not indicate severe depression. It primarily focuses on a specific situation where the poster has discovered their mother's behavior of messaging a man obsessively. While there may be some emotional distress and confusion expressed, there is no mention of the typical symptoms associated with severe depression, such as a deep sense of hopelessness, lack of enjoyment or fulfillment, or overwhelming emotional pain. The tone of the post seems more concerned and seeking advice on how to handle the situation rather than displaying symptoms of depression."
"Post: My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks Hello everyone, This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this. Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). I have 1 older brother, 2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :)) I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers. I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"". This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone. But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed the first 2 years lol. I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. The only way i felt better was with playing runescape. YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy. And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

She understands what I’m going through and try’s to be supportive, but I constantly make actions that push her away. I enjoy hanging out in groups so I can just fade away without anyone really noticing to much (compared to one on one). I really can’t live like this. Things are far from the worst they’ve been but i can feel things sinking and sinking.

"Post: Laughed today from an unexpected source Particularly rough night I’ve been having alone with my thoughts. Decided to text one of these crisis hotlines for the first time ever... no one was around to reply for an hour. I found myself laughing pretty hard at the irony of not getting a response from a suicide crisis hotline. Go figure. But hey, crisis momentarily averted lol"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a mix of emotions and experiences commonly associated with depression. The poster describes a rough night spent alone with their thoughts, which suggests feelings of isolation and emotional distress. The fact that they reached out to a crisis hotline indicates that they may be in a state of crisis or contemplating suicide. The mention of not receiving a response for an hour and finding humor in the irony suggests a dark sense of humor as a coping mechanism, but also highlights the disappointment and potential feelings of abandonment they may be experiencing. The overall tone of the post, as well as the mention of crisis and suicide, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: My dad died today So I’m 16, coming on 17 next month. Today my dad died at 42. He hasn’t been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and he’s been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues. My mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday she’s been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course he’s stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided she’d have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life. I was there to see a fresh dead corpse. My dad. My *dad.* To say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. I’m just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didn’t have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch. All of it feels unreal and at the same time scarily real. Everything is numb. I’m lost."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a profound sense of grief, shock, and emotional pain. The poster vividly describes the events surrounding their father's death, expressing a deep sense of loss and disbelief. The intense emotional reaction, the use of strong language, and the emphasis on feeling lost and numb indicate a significant level of emotional distress.

Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has been going to therapy for several months and recently received a diagnosis of depression.

"Post: Debunking “stigma” Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response “you’re stigmatising people with mental health issues” What’s more stigmatising? Telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry, and bad genes? Psychiatrists/psychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions, only drug, or involuntarily “hopstialise” people Telling people they can’t overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which doesn’t operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug? Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as “different” due to “mental illness” and subjugating the “norm” from the “mentally ill” subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of “psychiatric medicine” Telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like “schizophrenia” and they’ll never really live a normal life. Yet we’re the stigmatisers? YOU’RE the one who solicitates a lawyer when you have tried a psychiatric drug that almost made you kill yourself now you want to fight psychiatry but you’re okay with kids being chemically lobotomised on Ritalin? How many more expansions of diagnosis in the dsm? does it have to be to wake you sheeples up that Collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of “disease” with symtomps does it have to be to tell you that these behaviours aren’t found through cellular pathology, brain scans, blood tests, or some medical diagnostic criteria? How many more deaths, school shootings, senseless violence, suicide by the administration of drugs? Will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry has killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the Jewish halocaust? It’s time to wake up and see that the “stigma of mental illness” is just psychiatric propaganda to deflect all the damage and life’s runid by their tortuous domain and authoritarian political reign. Wearing a badge upon your head saying I’m “bipolar” is self deprecative as you’ve surrended your mental factilites and human experience/emotion for the NIMH who’ve admitted you can’t define “mental illness” and want to use you as some priori for the campaigns to sell treatment therapy and drugs. Own titles like “I beat depression” I “beat bipolar” not resigning yourself to a pathetic existence of numbing your emotions and dying 20 years younger on psychiatric drugs."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a strong sense of anger, frustration, and resentment towards psychiatry and the mental health system. The poster challenges the notion of stigma associated with mental health and criticizes the medical model of mental illness, questioning the effectiveness and safety of psychiatric drugs. The use of strong language, references to suicide, mass homicide, and comparisons to the Jewish Holocaust indicate a high level of emotional distress and a distorted perception of the issue. The overall tone suggests a deep-seated resentment towards the mental health system and a belief that it is perpetuating harm and controlling individuals' lives. These expressions of anger, hopelessness, and conspiracy-like thinking align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really. Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it. The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with. My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt. When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer. My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well. I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers. I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A. A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing. I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. A hated me by that point.

"Post: My depression is getting worse And the bad thing is that I already did all the things that someone would say to a depressed person. I've talked to a lot of psychologists (for about 5 years or maybe more), psychiatrist, I've been on antidepressants meds, I Meditate every day,I have been on several nofap periods (I broke a lot of streaks btw), I do physical exercise (I used to be a gym rat) and when I'm out I try to be social (I'm out basically only when I go to work or to the gym). But still my life is shit, I don't have friends, neither a gf, social interactions with women are nearly 0 and I think that all of them are bitches. I'm also poor and I don't see any way things can get better, I feel like I tried all the things that should help and nothing has helped .

"Post: How to get over my ex best friend Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that I’m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being “friends” again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though she’s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didn’t talk much and she didn’t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didn’t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. I’ve known it’s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesn’t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately I’ve cried so much. I haven’t been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasn’t THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how she’s doing and it just really sucks. :("," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Best friend drifting away? I've debated whether to post this or not for ages. My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy. But at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her. Any advice?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does exhibit some emotional distress, such as feeling like they've lost their best friend and being scared that the friend has lost herself due to the relationship.

"Post: I used to be so creative, and funny I used to enjoy writing, drawing and making people laugh. Now I'm just a shell of self hatred, and constant doubt. My social skills are out the window, I'm always awkward. I used to write short stories, and I haven't done that in several years. My drawing skills haven't advanced since I was a teen, which is is sad because if I had continued drawing, I would of been a lot better than I am now I bet. :/ I'm trying to slowly build up my artistic love by using adult coloring books, and doodling models. I've become so engulfed with my appearance (I have BDD and anxiety and depression) that I completely abandoned all other parts of my personality that made me special and interesting. I used to be so quick witted. I was always the funny friend, and I loved it. I hate how I am now."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a significant loss of interest and enjoyment in activities that used to bring the poster pleasure, such as writing, drawing, and making people laugh.

"Post: Doing things that I like reminds me why I don't enjoy doing them anymore. Playing your favorite game? You shouldn't. Remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly? When nothing else mattered but your game? Finished reading a cool book? Are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again? Don't forget your friends. Why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude? Faking a positive attitude is worse. If you're going to be yourself just stay home. Oh you got selected for a great job opportunity? Wait until they realize you're garbage at your job. You have time to relax now? Think again. There's always someone needing something or things that need to be done. Trying to treat yourself? Wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time. You're actually being responsible and starting work early? Wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore. Why does it matter to do things you like if you're just going to feel bad anyways? I've been conditioned to believe these things since I started college and I feel stuck. I'm trying to deny that I believe in these things, but the thoughts keep coming back. I know that I should take care of myself, but I'm so tired of living that I'm hesitant to do anything for myself."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I have no idea what to do My husband and I got into an argument last night that has lasted until this morning. Through out the entire argument, he has called me horrible names and hurt me deep. I thought i was almost over my depression, I thought i was getting better, but the things he has said has taken me from where I thought I was all the way back down to extremely emotional and having suicidal thoughts. The argument started because I was talking too loudly to his son while trying to correct his behaviour. I am 38 weeks pregnant, and lately have been easily annoyed and upset by the boy not listening to me. My husband called me a bunch of hurtful things because I tried to explain why I was so upset. Later on in the night he told me my mom and oldest sister were no longer allowed to visit me for the birth of our child. Then he spent several more hours talking about how they were ""rot gut whores"" and how he doesn't want them around HIS son all because 2 years ago my sister invited me to a christmas dinner she knew I wasnt going to show up for and didn't specifically include my husband in the invitation. Yet his mom is coming a few weeks after, and she had left him and his brother to fend for themselves in a trailer in the middle of a forest only showing up to bring them food when they called her and begged her for it. But because she ""hasn't done anything to offend"" me, he is totally ok with her showing up. Now he's talking about how if I want my mom to be here so bad, I can leave with her when she visits. And I've fully expressed how depressed I am to him and he isn't even worried in the slightest. He just keeps refering to my past as a teen who would sleep with practically anyone to try to get some sort of pleasure out of life, saying he bets I want to go back to that, that i would treat his son better if he were black, and that i would try harder to not upset my husband if he were black. Part of me hopes something goes REALLY wrong in the birthing process and that I will die or be put in a coma from it. I've never felt so useless, stranded, and alone in my entire life."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a number of emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a tumultuous argument with their husband that has left them feeling deeply hurt and emotionally distraught.

"Post: Hitting a rough patch-any words of encouragement or friendship would be helpful. Hey all, I’m having a really rough time-I’m confused, sad, and afraid. I’ve had anxiety and depression for years, but had some very good months until recently things have gotten very bad. My thoughts are dark and I feel trapped. I have close friends and family but I just can’t get the words out to describe how I’m feeling. I feel numb, dissociated from reality, easily fatigued, and just very sad. I don’t believe I will get better or my future is bright. I am convinced I’m destined to be unhappy and that I will not find love. I want to scream out with how awful I feel.

"Post: I was rejected &amp; I feel great Last night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished. To provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life. The depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely. Despite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected. There's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post has elements that indicate the poster may be suffering from depression. They mention being diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder and having experienced depression for a significant portion of their life. They also describe feeling worthless, guilty, and having engaged in harmful behaviors towards others due to their depression. While they express a sense of pride and accomplishment in asking someone out and accepting rejection gracefully, the underlying history of depression and negative self-perception suggests ongoing struggles with their mental health. The post does not convey a strong sense of hopelessness or despair, but the mention of past and ongoing depression symptoms aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Does anyone else go way out of their way for others, because no one goes out of their way for you? I have two roommates who are in a relationship together. I moved out of my parents house to live with them. I am on my own for the first time in my life. I have no one who cares about me anymore. Since it's Christmas, I bought them each a couple of gifts and also Christmas stockings since they've both never celebrated Christmas in North America. I filled them with a bunch of candies, chocolates, soaps, etc. It felt good to do this but also sad at the same time knowing I will wake up to nothing on Christmas morning."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of loneliness, sadness, and a lack of reciprocity in relationships. The poster describes going out of their way for others without receiving the same level of effort in return, which suggests a feeling of being unappreciated or undervalued.

The act of buying gifts and feeling both good and sad about it further indicates a sense of longing for meaningful connections and experiencing disappointment in not having those needs met.

"Post: relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice Hi, In a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me. I don't think I've been saying these things. It's really wearing me down, either I am being horrible and forgetting, or she is (perhaps unknowingly) making it up. I've recently said I'm going to record some of our conversations to see if I can prove my innocence, or find out I have an issue with my memory/attitude and get help. This has gone down very badly, she now insists I don't speak to her for at least as long as I may record her. What do I do? My goal is for my family to get along well, or at least OK - but I have no idea what I can do to fix things or make them better. Any thoughts or advice is more than welcome Fully aware this is my perspective, and I may have subjectivly squewed it - will try and answer any questions if asked"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I checked myself in to a Mental Hospital I decided after dealing with months of annoying suicidal ideation that I should go to a mental hospital. I say annoying because I was aware of these increased thoughts and wanted nothing to do with killing myself. While I wanted a closed environment away from home stressors to solve my issues I was also afraid of going somewhere unknown. I went through with it (despite crying and feeling emotional on the way there) to get my life turned around. I feel very often that horror stories are told of hospitals. In reality, if you need the help, please seek it out. You may have a completely different experience than someone who claims they don't remember their stay and was drugged up to their eyeballs. My experience was a pleasant one overall. I went there and focused on fixing my issues and I'd say I came out feeling better. I'm not sure if I can or should give the name of the place but I'm sure someone can let me know down below. I just want to share my experience and help people not feel so afraid of going to one. The place was pretty clean. An adult area for people 18 and over, rooms and halls split by gender. Bathrooms only seemed a bit off towards the end of the day or during the morning when people would shower. Roommates were sweet and tidy thankfully but the option to change roommates if there was a problem was always available to me. Groups were informative and engaging as well as encouraging for others to speak up if they wished. You had a good amount of personal time to do whatever. Outdoor activities were available permitting the weather. The place was meant for short stays of up to a week so anyone who's still there for longer may see the groups as too repetitive. The food was surprisingly delicious and great. Honestly expected school lunch type of food but there was variety and options for those allergic, vegetarian or needing gluten free food. There were staff members around whenever you needed them for anything. The treatment team could've been better. They were good to me but not to everyone there. Changed meds without informing me. I went from 5 to 10 to 15mg of Abilify. Good Lord I felt it once I was home. Then REALLY felt it when they made a mistake and I went cold turkey for two weeks because I couldn't get my prescription filled. I'll update once I'm properly back on it. So that's my experience. After a week, I came out feeling better. I got off of Wellbutrin after determining it could be the cause of my increased depression. The Abilify gives me energy to get up and not be stuck in bed all day. I feel better than when I went in. I know this is a long post, however I've been afraid of sharing my experience with others. I don't want to feel afraid of ashamed of having went, so here I am with this post. If this is also posted in the wrong place, please let me know and I'll gladly move it to the right subreddit."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of emotional distress that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster mentions dealing with ""months of annoying suicidal ideation,"" expressing a desire to go to a mental hospital to address their issues, and feeling fear and emotional distress about going to an unknown place. They also discuss the horror stories they've heard about mental hospitals, indicating a level of anxiety and concern. Despite this, they ultimately decide to seek help and describe their experience as a positive one overall. However, they also mention medication changes that were made without informing them, leading to negative effects once they were home. This suggests a level of vulnerability and reliance on medication for their mental well-being. The post conveys a mix of hope, fear, and vulnerability, indicating a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Today just sucks I've been sitting at my desk at work for the past hour and a half crying on and off. Not really sure why. I feel physically sick and I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and sleep for a few days. I'm supposed to teach a class tonight, but I'm really not sure I can function around people. I know I should just cancel it, but I feel guilty doing that, and I have no idea why. It makes no sense since I can't seem to bring myself to care about anything else right now- like the fact that I've gotten almost nothing done at work today and probably won't in the remaining 3 hours. I just don't know what to do anymore."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses a sense of overwhelming sadness and despair.

"Post: I can't study. Not even the thing i like the most I love history. I picked it this year and I can even take it as a hobby. I'm in contemporary history (my favorite period) and I have an exam on WWI and the USSR (it's a lot but that has never been a problem for me). But I can't study it. I turn my phone off. I get rid of all kind of distraction. But I can't. I've given up. I've been days trying to study, but my brain can't keep the info. I'm going to fail. And the worst part is that I'm passionate about this subject"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Ever have that moment where your depression teases you at the worst times, then tricks you into making you think you're ""fine"". Not sure how to explain it. Like, you really start to feel like shit at certain points during the day, but once you are near an item or person to communicate with (e.g. A journal or counsellor) you feel ""fine"" (not the good fine but the nullity type of fine). I don't know how to explain this and I don't like it because I want to be able to express this shit to the few trusted sources I have left."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post describes a common experience of depression, where the individual's depression sometimes intensifies and causes negative emotions, but then seems to dissipate when they are in the presence of something or someone they can communicate with, such as a journal or counselor.

The mention of wanting to express their feelings to trusted sources but feeling unable to do so suggests a sense of isolation and difficulty in seeking support, which are also common symptoms of depression. Overall, the post exhibits emotional distress and experiences that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: feeling betrayed My best friend and I are dating two guys who are also best friends and roommates. At first we all got along great and had a lot of fun. Out of nowhere my best friends boyfriend started voicing how he really felt about me. He told her and my boyfriend (his best friend) that he hates me and can’t stand to be around me. He even said “seeing her is the worst part of my day.” This is only one of many many rude and uncalled for things he has said about me. He acts as though I am a nuisance when I have never done anything to him. My boyfriend and I can’t even be around them anymore because of how bad it’s gotten. It hurts that my friend allows this to happen and wants to be with someone who acts like this. It’s weighing heavily on me.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: The Last of Us I just finished my second playthrough, PS3 (im poor, sue me bitch). after the part with the cannibals, ellie sat on a bench and didn't talk much. this, in combination with when she says ""he tried to..."" to joel after she kills david, made me get a bit angry and sad. then i thought about my female friends (few as they may be) and family and how if any ever hurt them in such a way, especially my family, well i think it's better if that's left unsaid. had to pause the game for a min to cry. i never thought i'd be so depressed that a video game could make me cry (and i've played a lot of games, over 1,200 trophies on PSN. only this one made me cry). and in retrospect, i now think i've come to appreciate at least one aspect of my depression: emotion and the appreciation of it. sometimes i can look at someone, there body language, listen to them and feel there pain, suffering and sadness. i now appreciate The Last of Us, life and other people more. although i did feel more alone afterwards (especially since i think it'd be wonderful to find a girl that has a personality like ellie's. never had a gf, had any physical romantic interaction with a girl or even been on a date. i was 12 when the game was released and will probably still be 16 when part 2 comes out, so we ain't dealin with no pedo shit in these christian suburbs) it was definitely worth it. -just thought i'd share that in the hopes that it would brighten someone's day.

"Post: Why? Why do I feel this way? Why am I always tired all the time? Why can't I get out of bed in the morning, take a shower, and be productive? I want to do so much but I just don't seem to care, or have the motivation anymore. A year has passed and everything is the same, I'm living the same day over and over again and I don't know how much longer it will last. Why am I always in my own head? I'm always thinking about the past, just wishing I've done things differently or even did things at all. If only I made other decisions in life maybe I wouldn't be where I am now, tired and alone.

"Post: Me and my brother cannot stop fighting This is DAILY. I'm 18 and in college, he's 15 and in high school. My mom works like 6 days a week and is barely home except for in the morning (when he's already at school) and at night (comes home anywhere from 9-11pm). He's nothing but a spoiled brat who gets everything his way, and we have to share a room in our condo which seriously sucks. I get 0 privacy and I'll be trying to do homework and he'll blast his stupid gaming YouTube videos and refuses to turn it down. I'll go downstairs to do it and he'll end up coming down 20 minutes later, and it's an ongoing cycle. He gets really mad and throws a lot of fits and I seriously think he's a psychotic freak. He was yelling at me and throwing a childish tantrum a few months ago and one of the neighbors called the police, but they never came to our door. Since then, he still hasn't learned his lesson and STILL continues to throw these huge fits when he doesn't get his way. We've had a rough past, and he doesn't realize that since my mom is always working that I'm basically the one that's in charge around here. I'm not bossy, either, I am completely fair. But since I've always been the one to do everything, he's used to sitting on his overweight ass all day playing video games. Now that I'm a full time college student, I don't have time to do things around the house that I could before. He refuses to do anything including even fixing his bed. I tell my mom ALL the time to do something but even if she does, he'd throw a fit. I seriously think he just needs to be put on medication because his behavior is very VERY out of control. We've been arguing and fighting so bad daily for the past year or two and it's just getting progressively worse. I don't know what to do. I seriously would move out right now but that's not an option as I don't have time to work a full time job and take 17 credits while paying for schooling AND rent/utilities/gas/etc. It's just becoming such a toxic place to come home to that I just stay at the library or starbucks because I dread coming home because I know he'll always start something, but even when I do come home it's always yelling and fighting even if I bite my tongue and stay silent. He DOES NOT LISTEN!!! He thinks HE'S in control. If he were my child, I would've taken every possession he has (iPhone, Xbox, etc) and made him sit in his room all day being forced to read a book and learn to respect people older than him! He talks back to my mom A LOT, and the thing that makes me mad is we won't even do anything to him. I know people will be trying to say, ""Well maybe don't try to boss him around"" but the thing is I DON'T. I'll just be like, ""Make sure you clean your half of the room"" or ""Be sure to take the dog out"" or ""Make sure you unload the dishwasher"". I don't know what to do anymore. I think I'm gonna force him to go sleep in the basement because I haven't even gotten a full nights rest since summer and I feel like I'm starting to get depressed. Every day he's always calling me names, and it gets so bad that I have to call him something back in order for him to even realize what he's saying to me. I'm just so over this and this extra stress is seriously making me feel nauseous trying to balance school along with it. I've tried talking to a few people about this, but all they say is, ""Awe it'll get better"". WELL AT THE RATE IT'S GOING NOW, IT WONT. I just don't know what to do. It would be a lot easier if I had my own room so I could get a quiet space for privacy and alone time away from him."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on the poster's frustrations and conflicts with their brother, as well as the impact it has on their daily life and well-being.

Post: So I graduated but fucked up my exams so bad that my u ivesorty rescinded their offer of admission. I've thrown up 4 times in the past hour after reading their email.

"Post: My boring sob story Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling. Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset. It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reflects a deep sense of emotional pain, flat misery, and disconnection from one's emotions.

This suggests a significant loss of interest and motivation, which are common symptoms of depression. The person also expresses cynicism and a negative mindset towards others, which can be characteristic of depression. The mention of trying various medications and therapy without success indicates a prolonged struggle with their mental health. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-blame, and feeling like they've exhausted their options aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I feel like I am annoying my friend. I have noticed recently that I have been texting my friend a lot and I’m the one to always start the conversation.

Has something like this happened to you?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits some mild signs of self-doubt and insecurity, but it does not strongly indicate very severe depression.

"Post: I don't even know I don't know if I'm depressed or just the good 'ol sad. I can't fully express how I feel because the inside of my head is a mess. I don't want to give what I feel everyday the label of ""depression"", I feel like it just insults the people who knows they have depression. I have no idea where to get any help for whatever I feel. If I did, I would either be too lazy or too shy to ask. I am too lazy. Everything is just too tedious. In everything I do, halfway through it I just feel an intense urge to give up, and I do. I can't find a proper hobby to distract myself from whatever's inside my head. I can't focus. It is so hard to focus on anything. I just stared at the blinking blue bar for 5 minutes just to type this unecessary sentence, because I lost whatever I wanted to write here in the maelstrom of thoughts inside my head. I used to be smart, or atleast feel smart. Lately I feel like I've dumbed down. Questions that I used to answer easily became hard for me. English, something I was proud of for learning it by myself, became harder for me. My memory isn't what it used to be. I'm jealous of other people who can properly comfort their depressed loved ones. Everytime, it pains me that I can't find anything in my head or say anything to make them feel atleast a little better. It eats me inside that I know they're suffering and I can't make them feel that someone cares when they think that no-one does. I am a fake. i'm not sure if any of you will get what I'm saying but, eh. I can't even understand myself."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a number of emotional indicators that suggest the poster is suffering from depression. The poster describes feeling confused and unable to fully express their emotions, indicating a sense of internal turmoil and mental chaos. They also express a hesitancy to label their feelings as depression, potentially due to a fear of invalidating others who have been diagnosed with the disorder, which could be indicative of low self-esteem or self-worth. The mention of feeling too lazy or shy to seek help suggests a lack of motivation or decreased social interaction, which can be associated with depression. The poster also describes difficulty focusing, memory issues, and a perceived decline in intellectual abilities, which may be symptoms of depression-related cognitive impairment. The feeling of jealousy towards others who are able to support their loved ones with depression suggests a sense of isolation and the belief that they are not able to provide the same type of help or support. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-doubt, and frustration with oneself aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

"Post: Family Vacation. Is this rude? My fiancé' and I are headed to a family vacation at an amusement park for six days with his family. There's no set schedule, except for one family dinner and one family breakfast. Everyone is in different life stages, so it was best to let everyone venture off on their own. I figured we'd coordinate events and rides with folks once we got there but nothing set in stone. My cousin lives there, about 25 minutes from where we are staying and I haven't seen her in years since she moved due to bad timing and life events. We were going to go meet her for dinner one evening (probably about an hour or so) during the trip. Is this rude?

How are you supposed to feel when you take them &amp; they’re effective? i’ve been feeling depressed since i was 19, i’m 21 now. i learned to live with my depression. i took group therapy, then individual therapy but didn’t find comfort/couldn’t open up to my therapists. i don’t talk to anyone about my issues, so kinda now have a feeling of numbness. i kinda learned to live like this. i feel normal, i used to feel like there was a cloud over my head at all times. My older brother is severely depressed &amp; was prescribed Zoloft. he offered me a one &amp; i took it in the late afternoon. i felt more outgoing, him &amp; i hung out. The next day, i went to work &amp; was doing an outstanding job with my performance. i didn’t mind being at work. after i had a break at work, i ate a bagel &amp; then i was in the GREATEST mood ever. i was so happy. a customer even called me out for being so smiley, but i couldn’t help it. i cleaned my entire house, i applied for Spring classes for school &amp; even was thinking of long term dreams of becoming a lawyer. i loved how positive i was feeling. i smoke weed, i felt exactly like you feel when you’re high, except i didn’t feel slow. is this how antidepressants are supposed to make you feel if theyre working? i kind of want some now if it means i love life"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a long-standing history of depression, beginning at age 19 and continuing until the present (age 21). The individual describes previously feeling like there was a cloud over their head at all times, indicating a persistent and negative emotional state. They have tried group therapy and individual therapy but did not find comfort or feel able to open up to their therapists. They mention feeling numb and have learned to live with their depression, suggesting a resignation to their emotional state. 

When the individual took Zoloft, prescribed to their brother for severe depression, they experienced a significant change in their mood. They felt more outgoing, had a positive experience hanging out with their brother, and experienced a great mood at work. They were exceptionally productive and even felt happy to the point that a customer noticed their smile. They engaged in various positive activities, such as cleaning their entire house and applying for school classes. The individual describes feeling similar to the effects of being high on weed, but without feeling slow. They express a desire to have similar positive experiences with life if it means taking antidepressants.

The post indicates a significant improvement in the individual's emotional well-being after taking Zoloft. They describe feeling happy, productive, and motivated, with a newfound optimism and enjoyment of life. This aligns with the potential positive effects of antidepressant medication. The contrast between their previous experience of living with depression and their current positive state suggests a significant change in their emotional state, supportive of the idea that they might benefit from antidepressants."
"Post: Something i wrote during one of crying fits Bridges were burned Yet my heart it still yearns Lessons were learned Inside I still burn Not a flame of love, nor an ember of passion A blue flame lit, reminiscent of what I'm lacking A lonely lit candle that pains my insides Those tears of mine dried up, no longer can I cry New year, I'm out of luck, anxious and somber here I lie I scratch and I scratch, yet numbness blocks out the feeling There's no way to patch up, I'm broken glass I'm far from healing Empty conversations with people I could not care less about I envy healthy relationships, ones that I could not have, no doubt Eyeballs that cannot weep and screams without sounds I'm still depressed when people are around Yet I'm hard to read, I'm one to bleed Waste time as I scroll through my social feeds Waste hours as thoughts take over and I can't sleep I cannot compete Yet I cannot accept Looping like a gif in my head The words you said Up until now And from the day that we met. If you read this thanks for reading."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

The poster describes feelings of yearning, sadness, and emptiness, indicating a lack of fulfillment and a deep emotional pain. The mention of ""crying fits,"" ""numbness,"" and being unable to cry suggests a sense of emotional numbness and difficulty in expressing or processing emotions.

"Post: Might have gotten my friend fired at work First of all: hello! I’m just gonna jump right in. So I (23/f) have been best friends with this girl (let’s call her maya) for about 3 1/2 Years now. Another girl (we will go with Ashley) became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time. Eventually, maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time, so we obviously didn’t really put a lot of hope into the whole thing. But eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya. Now she started really getting into weed (like 3 blunts a day all by herself) and then dropping pills on the weekends. Ashley and I are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a) fell asleep b) throw up all the time c) was just super uncomfortable to be around. Also work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it... so we were always late with her. Last week it really excalated: she left Ashley hanging for over an hour, didn’t pick up her phone, I cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests. And all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss. (Not even a reason why all of it happened) Obviously, we were both really pissed and I just told our superior what had happened and why I was there instead of her. Needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go. The issue is, she kind of expected us to lie for her and I don’t think I can deal with that anymore. She has become so enstranged lately and I don’t want to support her selfish and self-destructive behaviour. But now I guess I might have made her lose her job and i don’t know if I should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that she’ll hate me forever and go on with my life. I’ve told her that I don’t like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off, called me a coward and sheltered. But she also treats me (and Ashley to an extend) like her servants and all my other friends can’t stand to be around her. So really, i don’t know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end I’m going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life. Should I apologise or/and try to damage control the whole thing at work? TLDR: friend has drug problem and left all of us hanging at work again so i didn’t play along with the hundredth shitty excuse She wanted us to tell"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the post suggests that the poster may be suffering from depression. The language used conveys a sense of guilt, self-blame, and despair, indicating a significant emotional distress. The poster expresses concern about potentially losing a friend's job, feeling responsible for their friend's actions, and contemplating whether to apologize or try to minimize the consequences of their actions. These thoughts and emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and hopelessness."
"Post: In a bad headspace after a breakup with someone who finally made me feel like things would be okay It’s been a week since I returned from a six month exchange program overseas. There, I ended a 2y relationship with an addict, who I still cared for but could not love anymore. Then, of course, I fell in love with someone. We were inseparable for the six months. As I struggle with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder, it hasn’t been the easiest for him. We planned to end our relationship and continue as friends, but just couldn’t bear to at the departure gates. We decided to try a long distance relationship, but after a week, he’s had enough of me. He has his own problems, and we live 20 hours apart with a 12h time difference, so I don’t blame him at all. I do however carry a lot of resentment for myself for being so down in the past week and pushing him. I used to be really sociable, but a multitude of issues have led me to slowly isolate myself from people. I still have friends, but they either don’t actually gaf or they have their own problems and I don’t want to add on to their burdens. It’s also very difficult for me to meet people without any alcohol or drugs to calm the anxiety—something I’m trying to stay away from as my addiction problems have led me to the psych ward. Besides, how much can friends be there for you? It’s you alone in your bed staring at the ceiling til noon the next day for days on end (I’ve had terrible insomnia since coming home). I’m still on school break, cannot really occupy my mind by going outside to meet friends or take a part time job or just walk around due to anxiety and psychosis, and all the things I used to watch/do to cheer myself up (music, slam poetry, writing, youtube, netflix, games) I have associated very strongly with him as we have very similar habits. So anything that could make me pass the time makes me sad. I’ve loved and lost many times and I know it gets better eventually, but currently it gets very very dark in my mind and I’m not sure what I can do to survive in the meantime. I’m in a very bad place and feel very anhedonic and suicidal thoughts are back (having been accumulated from all these problems). He was the one person that made me feel like someone understood and was there in this big bad world, and without him I feel like I’m floating and nothing will make me feel okay again for a long time."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of being in a bad headspace after a breakup and describes their struggles with depression, anxiety, and schizoaffective disorder. They mention isolating themselves from others, difficulty meeting people without the use of alcohol or drugs, and feeling alone in their bed. The poster also discusses insomnia, anhedonia (loss of pleasure or interest in activities), and suicidal thoughts. They express a profound sense of sadness, emptiness, and hopelessness, emphasizing the belief that nothing will make them feel okay again for a long time. These strong emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
Post: My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers. Which not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time. Because if I try and fail its worse because I’m expected to succeed. I don’t even understand why they expect me to be the successful one. I barely got acceptable grades in high school until senior year when I just took easy courses. I failed English and nearly failed Spanish in 9th grade because I was too lazy to put in any effort. I barely ever brought home friends or did extracurricular activities most of high school. But for some reason I’m their grand vision for who’s gonna make the family proud.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and a sense of failure. The poster describes how their parents' expectations for them to succeed only make them feel worse and unmotivated to try. They express confusion and frustration over why their parents have such high expectations despite their perceived lack of achievements in high school. The mention of laziness, lack of effort, and not participating in extracurricular activities suggests a possible lack of motivation and apathy, which are consistent with symptoms of depression. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of self-doubt, frustration, and a negative perception of oneself, indicating emotional distress commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years? Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesn’t matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background. There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories. Why is it happening? Because of mismanagement. There are no other reasons! Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupid… But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures. Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently. Do those families share this knowledge with humanity? No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money. I’m fortunate to collaborate with some of those families. What if I ask you: Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it? Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success? Many families are struggling in our society. They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month… No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals. In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth. Is there a solution? Yes! But, you have to implement some strategies. It includes not only intellectual, emotional and spiritual development, but financial evolution also. Without a strong financial fundament, it is almost impossible to cultivate wealth in your family in a long-term run. To be continued. Rey"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does mention feelings of frustration, procrastination, apathy, and depression, but these feelings are not the central focus of the post. The majority of the post is focused on the issue of preserving wealth within a family and discussing the importance of implementing strategies for long-term financial success. While the mention of depression suggests that the poster may be experiencing some emotional distress, it is not the primary theme of the post and does not indicate very severe depression."
Post: Is it obvious when you have depression? I wonder if I have some form of mild depression or I just have low self esteem. I became a mute quite a few years ago after acouple of events that got me down. I think it may have been catatonia. But I'm not 100%. Ever since then I don't feel like I got back to my normal self. I'm a lot shyer and I don't have much luck socially or romantically or in my career. The best way to put it would be I lost my personality. I can really beat myself up sometimes because I hate myself. When something bad happens I really start self loathing quite badly. I don't feel suicidal. I hate myself more than I hate my life. I blame my lack of success on myself. I don't enjoy things as much as I used to so I have no real hobbies. I don't think I'm likable and I can't even pass interviews these days. I lost my personality and that's why I hate myself. I'm unrecognisable to who I used to be so I isolate myself a lot more these days. I don't think significantly depressed but I wonder if mild depression is the cause of my loss of personality? Or could it be something else that caused me to change? All I know is I've lost a lot of confidence and I'm always beating myself up about it," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of depression. The poster mentions feeling like they have lost their normal self and their personality, which could be a sign of low mood and loss of interest in activities.

While the poster does not mention feeling suicidal, their overall tone and description of self-loathing align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences I'm living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of ""love"". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father's doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won't go into it here. We've tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney's and filing for conservatorship. The harsh reality I'm learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I'm told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle. To the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I've had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt. I'm not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders. Thank you."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of despair and frustration regarding the situation of elder abuse that the poster's father is facing. They describe the nightmare they are living and the various efforts they have made to seek help and justice, which have been met with limited success. The emotional distress is reflected in their description of their father's deteriorating mental state, explosive episodes, personality changes, and being unduly influenced and taken advantage of.

These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly when faced with overwhelming challenges and a sense of powerlessness."

Reasoning: The post reflects a strong sense of hopelessness, loneliness, and a lack of social connection. The poster expresses a belief that they will die alone and that nobody talks to them.

"Post: overbearing family. I (19f) am living away from home for college in my 2nd year. However, I still feel very under the control of my mother. It is just me and her at home, and rest assured she has always done her best for me but recently I’ve had enough of how much she expects from me. I am studying for grade 6 piano and the fact is that I simply don’t have time for it. She wanted me to do the exam for it after only studying it for 3 months (bare in mind I only get to practice once a week as I have no piano away from home - I come home at weekends). When I postponed it she screamed at me for hours and called me an idiot and various other things. I told her I was too busy with college work, I got my results back for college and did very well; however, she still wasn’t happy. First comment was “maybe you’re not as stupid as we think” and then said that I could do a lot better, even though I did really well. I never leave the house when I’m at home for weekends or any holidays because when I go out or meet my friends she makes it very difficult as she usually starts a row before I leave and guilt trips me about going. I have been wanting a full time bar job for summer, as that’s where my experience is but she is even controlling where I work and telling me where to apply to. She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying I’m on a permanent holiday. She is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as “your friend” in a sneering voice, and she won’t meet him. She is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled. BUT I am not giving out about her, simply want to understand why she is acting this way when I’ve given her no reason to distrust me and I’m trying my best. TL;DR - mother is controlling, putting huge pressure on me and is never happy no matter how well I do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post showcases a variety of emotional distress indicators commonly associated with depression. The poster expresses feelings of being under the control of their mother and feeling restricted and controlled in their daily life. The mention of being screamed at for hours, being called derogatory names, and experiencing guilt trips and manipulation aligns with emotional abuse, which can contribute to depression. The poster also mentions feeling overwhelmed by the expectations placed upon them and feeling like their achievements are never enough. The overall tone of the post reflects a significant level of emotional distress and a sense of hopelessness in trying to understand their mother's behavior. These emotional symptoms are consistent with those commonly experienced by individuals with depression."
"Post: I can't seem to be happy with my current life - only the future So I was diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of my life now. Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I can't seem to be happy about it, and only about the things that I hope I'll work towards in the future. I guess for example - I've lost a little over 30 pounds since February, the first significant time I've actually lost weight, and I'm now no longer medically obese... but I still just feel fat and haven't been able to feel anything good about the weight I've actually lost. I have a great job, and am just about to finish paying off all my loans, but I don't feel any accomplishment in that either. I keep thinking maybe I'll feel good when I have enough to put down a down-payment on a house, but I doubt that will be the case. I have a bunch of great friends, but I'm tired of being single again. I know that I should just focus on the good things right now, but it's not seeming to be any consolation. My faith life has been doing pretty good recently too, especially compared to the past, but I still feel like a shitty person a lot. I dunno, I know that so many other people are having a rough time and I should be happy with how things are going, but I'm just down right now."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post showcases several indicators of depression. The poster discusses being diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression and taking medication for it. Despite objectively positive measures in their life, such as losing weight, having a great job, and nearing the end of paying off loans, the poster expresses a persistent inability to feel happy or find satisfaction in these accomplishments. They describe feeling fat despite significant weight loss and feeling like a shitty person despite improvements in their faith life. The mention of constantly looking towards the future for happiness and doubting that even future accomplishments will make them feel good further indicates a lack of fulfillment and a negative self-perception, which are common symptoms of depression. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of hopelessness and dissatisfaction, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Abnormal I'm so used to being depressed and anxious I'm amazed how people can act normally in general. I'm like how do they do it? I'm so used to feeling uncomfortable in my skin that its normal for me to feel awkward and weird in social situations. The fact that people everywhere don't have to deal with this everyday and just can ""be themselves"" without breaking a nervous sweat blows my mind. I feel abnormal and tired of it. This is the part people don't understand. I've met shy people and they are effective communicators once they get over that initial hesitancy of speaking. When you're overcome with social anxiety, depression, and feelings of incompetency its damn near impossible to speak or want to. Every word you utter to someone is misinterpreted because half the time its not heard or not what you meant to say. So frustrating I can't explain it but its killing me. How I feel and how incapable I am in saying what I feel."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of depression and social anxiety. The poster describes being amazed at how others can act normally and feel comfortable in social situations, highlighting their own discomfort and feelings of abnormality.

"Post: I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable"" Probably a rant, but what the fuck. This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better. So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse. I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-; Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE** Edit 3: REALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HUG COMMENTS AND PMs ;-;"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling alienated and rejected by their friends after disclosing their depression, which has led to a worsening of their symptoms. They express frustration, confusion, and anger towards their friends' reactions, which further contribute to their emotional distress. The mention of their depression getting worse suggests a significant impact on their mental well-being. The poster also mentions their difficulty in finding new friends, indicating a lack of social support.

Everyone says it's supposed to get easier, but it doesn't. I've tried reaching out a couple times to talk to someone about it but they really don't want anything to do with me. I don't blame them though, it's not their fault nor are they obligated in any way to be friends with me. I feel like I'm becoming a bigger burden on those around me. I think I'm just not built for this world. I understand not everyone is, but I'm starting to come to terms with it and I'm getting really close... real close. I don't know how to cope with any of this and I'm just going to stop trying to. If it happens, it happens. No big deal in the grand scheme of things."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I'm quitting my job. I've been working at a department store for about 5 months yet, and I just can't do it anymore. There's too much to know and I just can't keep up. People who have been there 3 weeks are telling me how to do things. I sat down with my manager this morning and explained it all. The crying in the bathroom, the calling in sick because I'm too scared to go in, everything. She was really nice about it, and I decided to put in my notice. It feels like a failure, but I gave it my best try, and it isn't working out. I feel relieved that I only have 2 more weeks. I don't have another job lined up yet but I had to get out. I know that's not a good choice, but the anxiety is so intense there. I feel like a bit of a failure. A blind labradoodle could do this job haha. Ah well, can't win em all, right?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed and unable to keep up with the demands of their job, which may indicate a lack of motivation or energy commonly associated with depression. They mention crying in the bathroom and feeling intense anxiety in their workplace, which suggests a high level of emotional distress.

The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of resignation and relief at quitting the job but also a sense of self-doubt and disappointment, which are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Money and power are your friend, not human beings! I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. I am from a well-off family but I’d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didn’t help me even though she could - she didn’t even hide it. My parents didn’t like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo. Those well-off friends learned this news and they were excited about it. The woman who’d been ignoring me and hadn’t helped me out, volunteered to help my moving. I refused. When I had a house warming with them, they saw my place and was anxious to be invited to any of my future parties at this new place (yes, it’s a really nice place.) And then, they started to invite me to their exclusive parties and dining gatherings. They even asked me why I put some distance from them. It was ridiculous. Why did you guys act like you’d been caring about me so much? Life has taught me that my true friends are money and power, not human beings."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of cynicism and distrust towards human beings and friendship based on the poster's recent experiences. The poster highlights feeling ignored and excluded by their well-off friends, even during a time when they needed support. The emotional tone is one of bitterness and resentment. The poster also mentions how their friends suddenly became interested in them after learning about their new wealth and nice condo, which further reinforces the idea that they prioritize money and power over genuine connections. The overall negativity and lack of trust in human relationships align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: My favorite place to be is at home in bed With a pillow over my head. Cause it’s dark and it’s quiet. And I feel like I’m dead.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of despair and hopelessness. The poster describes their favorite place as being in bed with a pillow over their head, suggesting a desire to shut out the world and isolate themselves. The description of the place as dark and quiet, and the statement ""I feel like I'm dead"" imply a sense of detachment and emotional emptiness.

The overall tone of the post evokes a deep emotional pain, which indicates a significant level of emotional distress."
"Post: I've been sleeping with my best friends girlfriend for 3 years?? I'd be lying if I said I don't feel guilty. But on the other hand I still do it. We have been seeing each other behind his back for about 3 or more years every other day. She tells me everything about them. How sex with him is awful. Which I knew already because he asked me what he should do about it. I gave him good advice. I guess it didn't change anything. The sex with her is amazing. I think it's how taboo it is. We're all over each other. She lets me do things to her that She won't let my friend do on her , like anal I was the first one to ever do anal and throat fuck her and STILL do it. She wants a relationship with me and there's no way in hell that's going to happen. She thinks that I'm in love with her and that we will be together. She talks about us running far away together. All I have to do is say the word. I'm a big believer in ""once a cheater, always a cheater"". But she seems to be in love with me. My gut is telling me shes in love with me. My gut is never wrong. I guess I'm doing both of them wrong. I know he uses reddit so I'm not going to give all the details. I also want to add that I still respect the guy a whole lot. I would hate to lose his friendship. I know I should stop but the sex is just so addicting. She had sex with my brother too."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays a lack of empathy and a disregard for the feelings and well-being of others, specifically the poster's best friend. While there may be some guilt expressed, the overall tone of the post is focused on the enjoyment and pleasure derived from the affair. The post also mentions the addictive nature of the sex, indicating a strong attachment to the behavior despite the knowledge that it is wrong. However, the absence of emotional distress or any mention of negative emotions such as guilt or remorse suggests that the poster does not meet the criteria for depression."
"Post: Feeling insecure that my friend hates me I'm really stressing out right now. This happens all the time, I feel like my closest friend hates me. But recently, it's been getting bad. He's been ignoring me in person, taking forever to text back, and being really passive aggressive while texting me. It really hurts me that he does this, because he knows I have bad mental health, but he only makes me feel worse about it by making me feel worse about myself. This has been happening for the past three months, and I've had so many urges to tell him that we can't be friends anymore because he's hurting me so much. But I love him to death, when he is around, he supports me. But the moment he stops, he acts like I don't exist. It's tearing me apart. I'm scared to talk to him about it because I don't want him to hate me anymore than I feel like he already does, but I just don't know what to do about it. I feel so alone without him, and I really need some comforting words, and maybe some advice on what to do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple indicators of emotional distress and negative self-perception that are commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feeling stressed, insecure, and hurt by their friend's behavior. They express a fear of abandonment and a lack of support, which adds to their feelings of loneliness and despair. The post also mentions having bad mental health and feeling worse about themselves because of their friend's actions. There is a clear sense of hopelessness and a desperate need for comfort and advice, which aligns with symptoms commonly seen in individuals with depression."
"Post: Maybe I see the world for what it really is Maybe ""healthy"" people are the sick ones for being in denial. It would explain post natal depression. It's one of the worst times of your life, horrible things happen, it's gross. But people tell you you're meant to be happy. How could you be with a screaming baby and no sleep?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reflects a sense of disillusionment and questioning of societal norms. The poster suggests that ""healthy"" people may be in denial about the true nature of the world. They also express feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction with the expectations placed on new mothers, highlighting the challenging and difficult aspects often overlooked by others. The mention of postnatal depression and the contrast between societal expectations and the reality of the situation indicate a potential struggle with emotional well-being. The overall tone of the post suggests a level of emotional distress and a questioning of one's place in the world, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I feel like shit Hello everyone and happy new lunar year! Here is my story: I just came back from a casino joined by my family members only, we were having a great time together and everybody were well entertained. Things were smoothly going until I committed a foul as a result of my lack of understanding about a certain kind of gambling. Therefore, some of the participants of mine lost a small amount of their bet cash (likely because of my foul) and they said it was my fault. I was embarrassed because of my ignorance and I would have apologized each of them but I couldn't do it, I still feel I am guilty now. Now I cannot even look at my uncle face now"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of guilt and embarrassment related to a specific incident at a casino. While the poster may be experiencing negative emotions, it does not indicate strong indicators of very severe depression. The focus is on a specific event and its consequences, rather than a pervasive sense of emotional pain and exhaustion. The post does not mention any other ongoing symptoms or struggles with mental health, further suggesting that it may not be indicative of depression."
Post: They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem But it really feels more like people are a temporary solution to permanent loneliness.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of loneliness and suggests that other people are not able to provide a lasting solution to this feeling. The mention of suicide as an alternative indicates a high level of emotional distress and despair.

"Post: Friendships I am heartbroken.I have a gorgeous looking,kind,caring and funny 19y old son who is struggling to make friendships in Christchurch.He also struggled to make friends at school.Anytime meet ups were/ are organised they pull out on him.He told me today he has given up asking folk to meet up.He was fun and sociable within school and college hours but no one ever seems to invite him anywhere.He doesn't want or need pity but he would love some friends to hang out with :("," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of heartbreak and sadness regarding the poster's son's struggle to make friendships. The poster describes their son as being kind, caring, and funny, indicating that there may not be any obvious reasons for his difficulty in forming connections with others. The mention of the son's previous struggle to make friends at school and the consistent pattern of people pulling out on him when meetups are organized suggest a prolonged and ongoing issue. The poster also mentions that their son has given up asking people to meet up, which indicates a level of defeat or resignation. While the post does not exhibit the same level of hopelessness or despair as very severe depression, it does convey a sense of sadness, frustration, and loneliness that may align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: I don't want to get out of depression I've had it for so long I just can't get out amymore... I feel like I don't deserve to get out because of all the stupid stuff I've made...

"Post: I don't know how to go about this. Hey. Im Tomm. Ive had a fucking miserable time in the last 21 years. I havent been happy for the last 11 years and when i finally am happy and get into the swing of it, it fucks off and leaves me to suffer. Rant; for the last 10 years my dad has had cancer, hes not well at all. It seems im the only one who gives enough of a shit to help him. I wouldve moved away and had a life by now, but ive stayed purely for him. Last week i realised hes manipulating me to get anything he fucking wants. The girl ive been chasing for 6 months that i fell in love with has just fucked me off. Long story short about 3 months ago she had a 2 year anniversary with a guy but admitted she has a thing for me. So i waited it out and about 3 weeks ago they broke up so i thought 'hey, ill see if i can hang out with her and see what happens' nope. Told her i still feel how i did and she just says 'i see you as a friend and nothing more'. Maybe im just not cut out to be here, or to deal with people? Ive had a fucking terrible time, people to chat too would be nice."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a deep sense of emotional pain and distress. The language used, such as ""fucking miserable,"" ""haven't been happy,"" ""leaves me to suffer,"" and ""manipulating me,"" convey feelings of hopelessness and frustration.

They also mention a romantic rejection, which can further contribute to feelings of low self-worth and despair. Overall, the post displays significant emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Two weeks notice If I plan on killing myself, should I put one in and wait two weeks to do it? Seems kinda dickish if I just off myself while I’m scheduled to work, but it’s not like I do much there anyway. What do you think?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a plan to commit suicide, which is a strong indication of depression and potential suicidal ideation.

"Post: Been depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i was myself. Hey guys this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite. I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father). Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head. Weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track. Thanks in advance to whoever takes the time to read this long ass fiesta."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of severe depression. The poster describes being in a dark place for a long time and struggling with their mental health for about 2 years. They express a sense of disconnect from their former self and mention losing their carefree and energetic nature. The post also mentions a drop in appetite, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, all of which are symptoms commonly associated with depression. The significant decline in academic performance and weight loss further highlight the impact of depression on their daily functioning. Additionally, the mention of using weed as a coping mechanism and the negative effects experienced after quitting suggests a reliance on substances to manage their emotional state. The response from the poster's mother, dismissing their struggles as ungratefulness, further emphasizes the lack of support they may be receiving. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress, hopelessness, and a desperate need for advice and guidance, all of which align with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
"Post: Does anyone else feel insanely angry when they see injustice against others? Like I feel like I seethe with rage when I see others being mistreated Every time I watch the news about the political storm in America or anything I see in my twitter about police brutality or slavery in Libya, etc. I seethe with rage. I can't stand seeing so many people being tortured financially, mentally, physically. I hate it. I feel powerless and I feel angry. I feel like my depression grows with other people's pain. The more I see injustice, the more powerless and worthless I feel in the world."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Post: Sometimes I wish I had cancer or something so people wouldn't expect anything of me The bottom left of my ribcage hurts like a bruise but there's no visible bruising or anything like that. Been that way for a few days. Here's to cancer and giving up boys. 🍻🍻," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a desire to have a serious illness like cancer, indicating that the poster may feel overwhelmed by the expectations and responsibilities placed on them.

"Post: I feel like I'm not cut out to be an adult in this life. r/GetMotivated hardly helps me so I don't know why I still visit it. I always see some stupid bullshit like, ""When life knocks you down, get up and knock it down harder"" or whatever. I know it works for some people, but that stuff just makes me angry because it's *so* not me. I'm not a fighter. I don't understand how to just keep pushing and keep going on like that. I guess I've been doing that somewhat if I've made it to be 21 but I'm so fucking miserable. I don't understand how people get motivated and ""just deal with it"" and all that shit. And I know it's a meme to say that you're fine but don't want to get into because they wouldn't understand but it's so fucking true, and I know I'm just feeding into the cliches. Going back to the title, I think it's entirely likely I'm not meant to survive on this earth. In a universe that's so fucking vast, it makes too much sense for there to be the possibility that some humans just aren't meant to live like everyone else. Maybe I'm destined to kill myself. I'd rather not, I'd rather something else kill me so I *don't* have to deal with it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a strong sense of hopelessness, despair, and self-deprecating thoughts.

"Post: Mom always trying to ask me uncomfortable questions and gets mad when I express my feelings about them I'm 20 years old and I've been with my boyfriend a little over 2 years. I know I'm young. Will my relationship last forever? There's a good chance it won't because both of us are very young. However, that doesn't mean I don't know how to be in a relationship or know if I love someone or not. My mom has a bad habit of asking really odd, seemingly disrespectful questions to me and my brother about our relationships. A popular one she gives me is ""I don't think you love him, he's more like you friend."" She asked me this tonight over a phone call and I got upset with her and expressed how I feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that. Like she know's everything about my relationship, somehow, when I hardly tell her anything about it because her and my dad are quite old fashioned and very religious. She's told me things like this many times before, and usually I try to just try to brush it off, but I'm trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother. She went on to say say ""but i'm your mom, I can ask things like that."" I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she's older, but I just personally feel it's disrespectful to say that I don't love my boyfriend and that ""he's just a friend."" She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up. Am I overreacting? i feel like I shouldn't be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me. My parents have both lacked communication skills my whole life, and it's put us in a rocky relationship. I love my mom, but I'm just trying to get her to understand modern day relationships and me as pretty much a grown adult. Thoughts?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and discomfort with the poster's mother's behavior, specifically with asking uncomfortable questions about their relationship. The poster acknowledges the age difference and differing perspectives, but they assert their feelings of being disrespected and uncomfortable.

"Post: My family might break apart... Sorry this is a long post. Yes I know this is common thing sadly. But I don’t want it to, 12 years my family have been together. Just to start off, There is me, my brother, my dad and mum. So my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons I’m about to mention. We only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isn’t teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. He’s always threatening to me and my brother, “I’LL KICK YOU IN THE FACE”, “YOU’LL END UP IN HOSPITAL.” I’ve despised him for about 3 weeks and it’s actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money. My brother is slowly becoming like my dad.I’m trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isn’t working. I believe he can still change because he’s still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he won’t listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, “I’ll do it later”, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesn’t care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much. My mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. She’s basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. It’s sad, really. And me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 I’ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. I’m using my words, I’m trying not to yell. I’m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. I’ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better. I’m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he won’t listen. I’m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, it’s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. I’m trying to get my brother to see the future like me. So just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad haven’t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her. My dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again. So just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother won’t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, “You don’t have the authority to tel me to do anything”. After this my mum asks me, “what should we do now?” Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us. Thats too much arguements for just 2 days, don’t you think? And my mum is right, what can we do? There’s too much problems with all of us, and we’re all depending on each other so it’s not easy. My mum would’ve divorced dad long ago if she had the money. I want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad. We haven’t called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad. We haven’t got outside help because our parents think it’s embarassing. So, what choices do we have?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does express a significant amount of emotional distress and describes a dysfunctional family dynamic. The poster discusses their father's anger issues, the fear and threats they experience, and the negative influence their father has on the family.

"Post: Telling my bestfriend she's long winded without hurting her feelings? My bestfriends and I have been bestfriends for about 2 1/2 years. We met in our college choir and are still in college, just for context. When were at school we basically hang out every night and I love her but when she gets started its like she doesn't know when to stop. I've had to resort to redirecting my attention when she's been going on too long. She tells me the same, or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking. Even when I bring to her attention she mentioned something before it usually never stops her from telling me again. It does get kinda awkward when I have to ignore her but it hasn't stopped her from rambling. I just don't want to hurt her feelings because I know she talks to me because I'm one of the few people she feels this open to drain everything into. Any advice?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The focus of the post is on seeking advice and guidance regarding how to address an issue with a best friend who tends to be long-winded.

"Post: My husband is not my best friend. Friends jealous of friends. My husband isn’t my best friend and that’s ok. In fact, it’s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find. However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I don’t have a live-in best friend. I don’t spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that I’m sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with “partner bffs” hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so they’d stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were “best friends” till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply don’t take their priority anymore. But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? I’m doing my best? I know there’s nothing but love on my part. So it’s not truly my problem, right? (Easier said than done with that mindset though) TLDR: my friends boyfriends/fiancés are their best friends. They get jealous of me getting close with or making plans with other friends while theyhangs with their bff partners. Not my fault right?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not display strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses some insecurities and worries about their friendships and feeling guilty when making plans with different friends, there is no mention of profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression.

"Post: Seeing doctor this week to talk about my depressive symptoms. Is it bad if I ask to be put on AD’s? I’ve had some symptoms of depression for awhile (no motivation, always tired, mood changes, sadness, etc.).

"Post: Am I being paranoid? I joined Girl Crew a few months ago. For those who don't know, it's basically an app for women to make friends. A few of us girls met up twice and have a group chat. We're planning to go to a rally tomorrow, and we all expressed our interest in getting a drink afterwards. Two of the girls tagged/mentioned the others in the group in something on FB - places to go for drinks. Both times I was not mentioned, despite saying that I'd like to go. So, am I being paranoid? Or do I have a right to be upset? Rationally, I shouldn't be. We don't know each other that well, so they can't hate me yet. But I don't know. I didn't make the best first impression, so maybe they don't want to be near me at all. I might not even go tomorrow; I might remove myself from the group chat/delete them off FB. What should I do?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays some signs of insecurity and self-doubt, but it does not strongly indicate a severe level of emotional distress associated with depression. The poster questions whether they are being paranoid or have a right to be upset about not being mentioned in plans made by their new friends. There is a sense of self-awareness that their reaction may not be rational and acknowledges not knowing each other well enough for them to hate the poster. While there is some mention of removing themselves from the group and feeling insecure about their first impression, it does not reach the level of hopelessness, lack of enjoyment, or overwhelming emotional pain typically associated with very severe depression."
"Post: My Boyfriend Talks Daily About Suicide -- Won't Go To Hospital Hi guys, I'm really just at a loss for what to do. I am absolutely gutted. My boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week. Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving. I have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help. I feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. What can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: You cannot be whatever you want to be No matter how hard you try, if your goals are too high, you will not achieve them. You will never be a famous athlete, or writer or successful businessman. All you will ever be, is a beast of burden for this sadistic, torturous farce that is life. I know that, now.

"Post: God giveth and God taketh away, but lately he seems to just be taking from me. I'm tired of it all now. A little over a year ago my Grandfather who lived with us passed away. About 6 months ago my mother passed away. A week ago my father went into the hospital to have open heart surgery done on him, and today he came back and is definitely looking worse for wear. For the time being he can't do anything physical, can't drive, and just looks like he's in pain, and is talking about probably retiring. Meanwhile in my life i'm struggling between choosing to go off to college or getting a full-time job. Only just a week ago I was getting ready to start to apply to FAFSA in preparation for actually starting college this year -- now with recent developments i'm not sure if that's even a viable option. I'll probably need to stay home and help out by getting a full-time job since both me and my brother are reliant on my dad financially, and my brother is already in college. I really don't know what I want to do or what I even can do. Add onto more shallow but personal reasons for me to feel down, like the fact that I have no social life to speak of and honestly it's enough to make me seriously consider suicide. It all just feels hopeless to me, and I don't even really feel like living to see what the future holds because it feels as though it's all bleak in the long term."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair.

"Post: Reminder that it will get better. Everyday I get home from my part time job, I cry for at least half an hour before I get up to go inside and finish the rest of my day. Everyday I feel and believe that things just keep getting heavier to deal with. That my life will not become healthier and I won’t ever be happy. It’s one issues after the next, or all at once and I keep wanting (sometimes do) push it off to the side. Everyday I also remind myself that it will get better. Sitting here alone, sobbing my eyes out while texting this post, I don’t believe it in these moments, but I’m not giving myself any other choice/exception. I will beat this and be happy.

"Post: Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad? Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things. My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth. Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears. I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed. I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France. I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story.

"Post: There truly is no hope. For any of us. This is the bleakest truth of all. Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own.

My friends don't deserve to deal with me so I've isolated myself. They just enjoy shitposting and memeing, not a pathetic emo child who is literally incapable of being happy right now.

All notifications on everything have been off for nearly a week, I don't get on discord anymore. I just feel so alone, so helpless, so very tired both physically and mentally. Even something as simple as having to raid on WoW, my anxiety is horrible with dealing currently and I constantly stress out about people finding out that I'm unhappy because I don't want anyone to see me like this. It's pathetic. It's the only 'social' thing I do anymore and I don't even want to do that. Playing a videogame is too stressful. P a t h e t i c. There is no fixing me I've come to realize, I just accept what is going to happen to me since I know I don't deserve to be happy.

"Post: As I sit here waiting for my friends to come over, I’ve come to realize how important friendship is. Friends can take the place of family and at the end of the day our true friends are always by our side win or lose! Isn’t it funny someone not related to you can be so important. I’m grateful.

"Post: Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I can't shake the thought that says: ""why bother?"". ""Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?"". And on top of that I don't even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the ""normal people"" (in lack of a better word,) is that the ""normal people"" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I'm not sure if that (happiness) is for me... Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts?

"Post: What Depression is Like For Me. Having depression is like sailing with a hole inside your boat and only a bucket to keep you afloat. Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you ""it will all get better"" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you ""I'll be here for you"" and you take it as an insult. Depression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened. To pretend, nothing happened."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I Am Going to Kill Myself When I Move Out I've thought about doing it now, but I'm not retarded. I can't do that to my parents.

"Post: Housemate/friend won’t come out of her bedroom and is pregnant So my boyfriend and I moved in with our friend and her bf. We all had this idea of living together, hanging out, have dinner get togethers with our other friends &amp; board game nights etc.. it was all great and exciting but then at day 1 after the move, our friend and her bf just kept to themselves, in their room and hardly hangs out with us. Issues came up with them not helping out with the household chores and when my bf and I brought it up, they got defensive. Then our friend informed us that she is pregnant which changes the dynamics in the house even more as they now plan to get out of our shared lease early. That leaves us to figure out how to pay for the remaining months and look for a replacement. That’s fine, it’s their decision to have the baby. But then immediately after that announcement my friend just literally stopped talking to us, she won’t leave her room, and she would have her bf bring food to her room. In a rare occasion that she comes home while we’re in the living room , she doesn’t say hi or talk to us. I am really confused and hurt because I feel like I’ve lost a friend that I used to know. Now, it’s been a few months since I talked to her. She’s there in the other room behind a wall and it hurts that this is how we have to live. I honestly don’t know what to do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does express feelings of confusion, hurt, and a sense of lost friendship. However, these emotions alone do not signify very severe depression.

Post: I can't make it better I'm tired of nearly every aspect of my life. Changing it for the better would require money. To get money you have to work. Work is boring and tedious and makes me miserable. That goes for any job I could realistically obtain. I can't do more than part time. I'll never have the kind of money it would take to change my life in ways that might make me happier. There is no point to life so why suffer through the misery and hardship?

"Post: Torn. Need advice... Hey Reddit. I am not sure how to start all this but im going to explain to my best ability. Here goes. So, i have i had depression and anxiety give or take 3 years. I recently opened up about it to my girlfriend and she encouraged me to open up about it to my mother. I told her about almost everything. The one thing i did not mention to her was the... suicidal thoughts. Now, for our family “feelings” isnt our thing. We keep everything closed up and then repress it all. Thats what i have been doing for years not just with depression but everything. Now, these past three days have been brutal on me. I had no want to leave my bed or eat or even sleep. I just lay there and listen to music. I have been having suicial thoughts here and there these past three days. I will have happy moments here and there. But it doesnt last (shocker) and i just go back to feeling like pure awfulness. So, I am a 17 y/o male and I start senior year in August. We are a military family. My dream is the military. Thats all i have ever wanted. I want to follow my brothers footsteps because he is a total badass. All ive ever talked about to people, when they ask me what i want, to do is how badly i want to join the military. I do not think, with my current mental state, that i should go to the military. But i also fully believe that if i dont go i will disappoint everyone around me and they will be disgusted in me and i also believe that i will fall deeper into this dark hole i have been in. I have come to ask you guys, Any ideas on what to do? I am taking a cross country trip in 2 weeks with my brother and I will ask him some things about this and hopefully it will clear my head. Thank you for reading. I forgot to mention. I want to go get help. get put on medication. But the military doesnt accept people who are on anti depressants.

The mention of wanting to seek help and be put on medication but being concerned about the military's acceptance of anti-depressants also suggests a desire to improve their emotional well-being. Overall, the post displays a range of emotions and experiences that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Why is it that I forget information about certain people? Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded. I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though) I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off. I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. 1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new. I will speak when I'm spoken to. 2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. 3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on) 4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me. 5.) I don't open up to people easily. 6.) My social life is spent more online. 7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days) 8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. 9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety. 10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers. 11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job. 12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. 13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion) 14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them. 15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize. 16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons. 17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends. Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able) Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy. Example: B is big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. She also love chinese as much as I do. C loves to play video games just like I do. He doesn't like the customer is always right policy. I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people. Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Leapfrogger/Friend Stealer/Friend Poacher etc. Just for some context in my form group (like a morning register class or a house class as some call it) I sat at a table with people I didn't really talk to, but since I couldn't change seats I decided to make some friends with people at the table. In grade/year 8 or 9 I met two guys who are now great friends of mine, one I talk to more than the other since he stayed at home instead of at school due to health issues. Fast forward a few months and you have the situation above. So I started talking about a common interest with this guy we shall name Manny, now Manny and I only talked in form, and after I would go back to my main social circle with my best mate. After a while (about grade 9-10 maybe) I decided Manny should go and chat with me and my best mate's social circle for once, so introduced them both to each other, and they got on well. Now between year 10-11 I definitely noticed that Manny started taking more of my best mates interest, which makes sense and happens often so I didn't think of it. It only caught my attention when my best mate stopped inviting me to events such as hangouts at the park and going on cinema trips with my other friend who stays at home. Instead he would invite Manny and Manny would invite him and some of my other friends to many events like the cinema and sleepovers and whatnot. Over time I would be completely excluded from my friends activities and everytime invited them to do something, they would say ""im not sure if i can go"" only for me to find out they went with Manny somewhere. Sure we are all still friends but I feel like i'm being slowly excluded. Is this just me? What do you all think?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post discusses a situation in which the poster feels excluded from their social group and notices that one of their friends, Manny, has started spending more time with their best mate and other friends.

"Post: They told me that all they can do is replace my hard drive, but they can't recover my 10 years of bitter-sweet memories. So I bought an external hard drive, thinking that everything would be safe on it, right? If I'm gonna spend $50 on something, it should at least be good at something, right? So I exported every thing from the past 10 years onto it. Recently, my computer can't even read the hard drive anymore. I went to the customer help service and they said that they can't do anything to access my data and all they can do is replace it (within warranty). All my graduation photos, friend hang outs, and all just precious moments, will have to go. I've always been looked down upon. I was never up to standard to anyone.

"Post: What’s the point of coming up if you’re gonna go down? I moved to a new city with the love of my life after 5 years of loving him. I was ready to propose, I looked at rings, I called jewelers. I debated getting a ring of meteorite, you know? He’s super nerdy, super cute. Science geek and all. I’d like to think every guy buying rings thinks about the meteorite ring haha. Then he tells me that he feels like a she. I loved her no matter what. I told her I still loved her and that she’s going to be one of the most beautiful girls ever. I still planned to propose. I loved her more that she’s her true self. Then my heart gets broken. She tells me that she can’t see a future with me together. She tells me that she’s only interested in women. There wasn’t much for me to do but respect her true feelings. I couldn’t force her to love me. For a few weeks I lost my best-friend and my future. We still lived together, music helped, weed helped. I made friends. I tried to be happy, and for a little I think I really was okay. But it was so stormy, one tip of the scale and I was back to being broken. Then I find out that she’s seeing other guys. My heart was gone, the only feeling is that feeling when your heart drops to your stomach. It’s a little harder to swallow, did life get harder? Did she make it easier? I don’t know. I wasn’t good enough for her. She says otherwise. I know she means the best for me with her heart but man, did it hurt the same. I ask her to give me time, as a roommate, as a past lover, give me time to heal before you see someone. Please, just give me some time to heal. But she couldn’t wait. I don’t blame her, she’s discovering herself. She’s beautiful. I never had a chance. There are better men for her. I’m broken, the pieces stomped on. I try. I go to work. I exercise. I eat healthy. I tell myself “improve for yourself and no one else”. It’s a lie. Life seems to drag on, I try to smile, I miss my best friend. I try to act like everything’s alright to her. She can’t be seeing me like this, it hurts her too. I meet a guy. He’s cute, a little simple, but cute. We start to hang out, workout together even. He takes me to some of the most beautiful places, I try to swallow my doubt and bring my heart back. Somedays, I could swallow just fine around him. When I was sure I was ready, I told him. It was too late. I took too long. I was just dead. I made plans, wrote good bye letters, planned that my little siblings would get what money I had left. I know it’s selfish, I know it can get better. I even tried to find a program that sends emails at a certain time so everyone could get a good nights sleep before they received my letter. I couldn’t do it. I stood on the edge of a bridge, the edge of a cliff, wore my favorite clothes. Listened to my favorite songs. Every time I couldn’t do it. You never think of it as someone being brave. But I was scared, I couldn’t imagine how anyone took that step off, pulled the trigger, kicked the chair. They had to be brave. And now, I’m back. I’m ready to kick the chair, I’m ready to pull the trigger, I’m ready to jump."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Depression and grief I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16. Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself. I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful. After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions. I dont know exactly what I am looking for by posting this but I have really been struggling with the emotions I have been having and would appreciate some guidance and if not, some affirmation."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. 
1. The poster describes being diagnosed with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) since the age of 16, indicating a long-standing history of depression.

"Post: School failure I think I'm doing something wrong. I found myself in a situation where I was lucky to move to prosperous country. Except I'm 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I'm an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign). The welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life I want to live. I'm also anti-social and seem to fit the symptoms of ADHD, but my therapist claims it's just anxiety disorder and doesn't wanna prescribe any meds yet. I do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue, I can't seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me. Basically I'm unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it's rather depressing."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of failure, embarrassment, and hopelessness. The poster describes feeling inadequate compared to other immigrants and expresses frustration with their lack of education and work experience. The mention of studying in a field that doesn't interest them, struggling with language and learning concepts, and being unable to find a job adds to their sense of despair and feeling trapped. The mention of being anti-social and potentially having ADHD suggests additional challenges and hardships. The overall tone of the post indicates a significant level of emotional distress and a belief that their situation is unlikely to improve, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Does anyone drink daily? Worst year of my life. I used to cut myself and alot of other destructive things(i've more or less stopped those things). Things getting worse. Im trying to get better/improve but I just want a way to cope and feel better. Theres no need to suggest anything else. Ive either tried it, wont try it because its not for me, or due to my circumstances cant do it. I thought I could just start drinking again. Atleast until things get better. Im confident that I can stop if/when i need to im just thinking about the health effects. Atleast i'd legitimately be happy while im drunk so i'd rather do that than say cutting myself or od'ing on medication."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

The mention of wanting to start drinking again as a means of escape and feeling happy suggests a possible reliance on alcohol to numb emotional pain. The overall tone of despair, hopelessness, and consideration of harmful behaviors aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: My bio dad died and his family didnt tell me until 3 days later... Him and I were never very close. Probably an understatement considering our only interactions were him calling drunk and calling me dirty names since the age of 14. I believe it started at 14 because I had sent him a letter wanting to have a relationship with him. I just wanted to know my dad even if it wasn't a super close relationship I still wanted one. Well fast forward 6 years later he's in the hospital for nearly a month and no one tells me, not even his sister who I am in contact daily with. Finally he passes away last thursday. He was intubated and couldn't speak for most of his hospital stay. He was 39. I asked his side of the family why nobody told me he was in the hospital or why nobody told me died the day it happened. Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth). I am also not invited to the service. Should I feel duped? Should I feel cheated out of a chance to say goodbye even though we weren't on the best of terms? Because his family and girlfriend sure as hell made it clear i don't even deserve to grieve. All i wanted was a relationship with him and all I got was name calling and him taking me and my mom told court over the $200 he had to pay in child support each month. I wasn't very nice to him, I tried to be.. But he made it so hard. So was it really they're call to say I couldn't see him. Or am I right to feel this way.."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reveals a deep sense of emotional pain, grief, and confusion. The poster describes a tumultuous relationship with their bio dad, marked by verbal abuse and neglect. The sudden news of his death, and the fact that the poster was not informed until three days later, evokes feelings of betrayal and isolation. The poster questions their own feelings of grief and whether they have the right to mourn despite the difficult relationship. It is evident that the poster has experienced significant emotional trauma and is grappling with complex emotions related to their father's passing. These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Roomie read a text I sent about her on another friends phone So I'm gonna delete this right after but I kinda fucked up bad... I'm a 24 yo female btw living in an apartment w 4 other ppl. Ok so I came home from a stressful night and one of my roommates was drunk af, I left to go see a friend for a bit and when I returned there was a pot of mac and cheese sitting on the stove with the burner on high and no one was around... turns out drunk roomie started cooking then abandoned it there. What annoyed me more was that it was my mac and cheese she cooked and burnt. I understand we get drunk and we take our roomies food... it happens ok, I've done it (rarely) but yeah it happens. I was mainly annoyed that the stove was on high and left unattended while she went out partying! If I wouldn't have come home it could have started a fire. SO me being the idiot I am, I sent a text to our other roomie just explaining that I was a bit annoyed that our other roomie left the stove on and was also using my food wo asking. It wasn't shit talking in my opinion, as the text legit said.. ""I just came home and _____ left the stove on and burnt food and left it there and it was also my food so I'm a bit annoyed"" Me and said roomie had been talking earlier about how we were a bit annoyed she came home so drunk and loud. I legit just said I was a bit annoyed bc she left the stove on and used my food. But I wasn't like incredibly mad I was just venting bc I know I'd get over it in an hour and just tell her tomorrow not to leave food unattended or ask if she'd like to take some of my food.... SO here's where im dumb.... my other roomie left her phone in the kitchen and the message must have popped up or the other girl was snooping through her phone and saw it.... she then proceeded to text me bitching me out and sending awful passive aggressive texts. I remained calm and mature and just explained that yes I was a bit annoyed, but I didn't send the text to be malicious or shit talk, and that I wasn't mad at her. She turned it all around on me and now I'm left feeling like the mean person. The only person I normally vent to about friends is my sister and no one else.. I don't like ""shit talking"" but everyone gets annoyed and needs to vent from time to time. It's healthy to get it off your chest and I didn't mean for her to see it... also it wasn't a mean text or anything....and also she was the one to disrespect me so I feel I had a right to be annoyed, though I shouldn't have sent that text but it could be a lot worse ... WHAT DO I DO NOW. She's so mad and ignoring me. Ugh."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses annoyance, frustration, and regret over a situation involving a roommate, there is no indication of profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more focused on seeking advice and understanding how to navigate the aftermath of the situation, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
Post: Post workout depression I have noticed lately that after a good workout the rest of the night i feel really great but the next day I'm more depressed than normal. Has anyone experienced this," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the individual experiences heightened levels of depression the day after a good workout. This suggests a pattern of negative emotions associated with physical activity, which is not a typical response for individuals without depression. The mention of feeling ""more depressed than normal"" indicates that the individual already experiences depression to some extent. The combination of these factors suggests a potential correlation between the workout and increased depressive symptoms, which may be indicative of a depressive disorder. However, further information would be necessary to determine the specific severity and diagnosis."
"Post: I'm getting annoyed constantly by one of my closest friends We've been friends since 8th grade, and she's a great friend, outgoing, funny, smart, the usual. We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better. I just don't want to do or say something I'll regret, especially because I know her life at home isn't great and she needs friends, but she shouldn't be pushing her problems onto me either"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there is a sense of annoyance and frustration expressed towards the friend, there is no profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues that are commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post seems more focused on navigating a complex friendship dynamic and expressing a desire for better connection and understanding with new friends. The mention of the friend's difficult home life suggests some empathy and concern, but it does not overshadow the primary issue of feeling like a third wheel and wanting friendships that are more relatable."
"Post: Can anyone cheer me up? Apparently, my dad used to work in another country. While he was away, my mom allegedly cheated on him several times. The only source of mine is my cousin, who gets the info from my sister. So I guess it is true. And to think about it, she did wear a lot of makeup back then. Not the normal amount I mean. To keep it short, when this hit me, I could not imagine her cheating on my dad. I’ve also heard that they are not divorcing because of me, which is plain stupid. All in all, I am pretty much down, I’ve never thought that she would be capable of doing such a thing. (19 year old guy here)"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional pain and distress. The poster describes feeling down and shocked upon learning about their mother's alleged infidelity. They express disbelief and a lack of understanding, indicating a significant emotional impact. The mention of wearing a lot of makeup and questioning their mother's behavior suggests a level of distrust or confusion.

"Post: Been medically diagnosed with depression I haven't been feeling the best physically lately dizziness, etc and I'm generally quite fit and healthy. I've been wanting not to do anything besides be at home with friends for while, my ex dumped me cause I would find it unpleasant to go outside of the house. But I don't feel sad at all. I don't feel worked at all I just feel like everything is going at 10x speed."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post mentions being medically diagnosed with depression, indicating that the poster has sought professional help for their emotional state. The mention of feeling physically unwell, experiencing dizziness, and wanting to stay home with friends aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as lack of energy and social withdrawal. The statement of not feeling sad and everything going at 10x speed may indicate a symptom of depression known as ""psychomotor agitation,"" where a person feels restless and experiences a sense of acceleration in their thoughts and actions. These indicators suggest a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Everything has changed... About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now. In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016. I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc... When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs... It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, trauma, and mistrust. The poster describes feeling isolated and misunderstood during their early years, finding solace and happiness when they finally connected with someone who shared their interests. However, this relationship eventually turned toxic and abusive, leading to the poster attempting self-harm. The mention of still being haunted by this past, feeling cynical and careless, and expressing a lack of trust in others suggests significant emotional distress and potentially symptoms of depression, such as difficulty finding enjoyment and a persistent sense of pain. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of hopelessness and ongoing emotional turmoil, which aligns with the symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I'm so lonely that I sometimes just want to talk to the dead. I need advice because I'm quite worried. I have a great family and a best friend and I'm super glad to have these people in my life. But, there's just one thing. I have this very lonely feeling and I sometimes just wish that I had a (good) spirit around me who I could talk to and share my insecurities. I am able to talk to the dead and I have seen many spirits before. I haven't seen one in a long time and I'm just way too scared to summon one or anything. (This is also incredibly dumb) I am not looking for a new (real) friend. Just someone who won't judge me. Is this weird? What do i do? Thanks."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ",yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of loneliness and a desire for connection with someone who won't judge the poster. They mention feeling so lonely that they sometimes wish to talk to the dead and express fear about summoning spirits. This suggests a significant level of emotional distress and possibly a disconnection from reality. The mention of feeling dumb and unsure of what to do further indicates a lack of hope or solutions for their loneliness. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression.
"Post: Has anyone been depression free for 5+ years? I get better then I get much worse, it's a cycle that won't stop. I'm wondering if there any older redditors that had severe depression as a young adult, and are now completely free from it? Depression is almost certainly going to kill me, whether it's the harmful way I cope to stay alive day to day, or more directly if I by some miracle can get my hands on a gun. Is there anyone that has been cured and not worries about depression creeping back? How did you do it?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, and the poster expresses a belief that their depression will ultimately result in their death. They describe a cycle of getting better and then getting worse, indicating a prolonged struggle with their condition.

"Post: Coming to terms with life long depression It's always going to be there in my life, like a dark cloud creeping in on a sunny day, and I'm okay with that. After 7 long years of battling depression and going through the highs and lows that come with it and after dedicating myself to therapy, medication and lifestyle changes I have finally accepted that I am going to have to learn to live with depression for the rest of my life. It's my strength, it's my weakness and it makes my life unique."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has been dealing with depression for 7 years and has gone through the highs and lows that come with it. They mention having dedicated themselves to therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes, which suggests a significant effort to manage their depression. However, the key indicator for the label of depression is the acceptance that they are going to have to learn to live with depression for the rest of their life. This acceptance implies a long-term and ongoing struggle with depression, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. Additionally, the use of terms like ""dark cloud"" and describing depression as both a strength and weakness suggests a complex and deep emotional experience related to depression."
"Post: Taking Tylenol PM, etc. in the middle of the day to sleep I work in an industry that I can be unemployed for months at a time. I have not had a job since Thanksgiving. I have decided to do something about it and move to a city where there’s more work in my field. In the meantime, however I find myself sitting in a dark room alone bored and ill often take sleeping pills like unisom, or Tylenol pm, and sometimes even Xanax and go to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. Like right now I’m struggling with the thought of taking one right now. I have anxiety and I don’t have much money to spend so I figure if I sleep a lot I won’t spend money. Am I completely messed up? Or does anyone else do this?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Is it bad that I understand why people feel the need to end it? Everything is so heavy right now that I feel like I understand why people do it. I don't want to myself, I can and will fight this, but it's just so defeating at times."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits a deep sense of understanding and empathy for why people may consider suicide as an option. The poster acknowledges feeling overwhelmed and defeated at times but states that they do not personally want to take that step and will continue to fight.

"Post: Finally got a job, but don't really care. So, finally after about 10-11 months, I got a job. The job isn't a bad one. Quite the opposite, actually. They specifically hired me saying that they weren't looking for someone to just stick for a year and move on; they wanted to hire someone and essentially keep them/train them eventually up to management level in the course of hopefully a year or two depending how well I take it. I said yes... though, mostly out of seizing a good opportunity. I'm not happy, or excited. I just don't care, really. &amp;nbsp; First and foremost, I'm a minimalist. The urgency of ""I need to save and buy a house"", or ""I need a secure career/future"", etc.. is non-existent in my life. Everything I own could fit in a van, and there would still be space left. I'm not exaggerating. I've even contemplated living in one; build some insulation to the walls, lay out some flooring, and call it home. I'd be absolutely 100% comfortable. Anyway~ My point is I actually have no reason to be taking this opportunity. The only thing that really ran through my head was ""I'll probably kick myself in the ass in the future for not taking this"". Considering this is a job that'll eventually lead to a solid annual salary within essentially no time, and requires no degrees or fancy stuff, it was kinda hard to say no. But it was also kinda hard to say yes. I don't have an endgame. I don't have a goal. At best, the closest thing to a goal that came to mind was ""Eh, I'd probably get back into riding, and buy myself a motorcycle or something"". That was it. My mind literally blanks after that. Nothing else is there. &amp;nbsp; I'm not suicidal. I don't go to sleep hoping that I'll never wake up again (though I wouldn't be upset by it), and I don't wake up upset that I'm alive for another day in life. If I had to describe how I feel right now... Everything is in a very, very quiet limbo. It's a very passive depression. &amp;nbsp; The best way I can summarize it is that this world has so much ""noise"", and it's exhausting for me. I get exhausted just from thinking about it. I wish people could just relax, and stop stirring so much motion around. It's always been like this for my entire life. I'm so tired. Everything/everyone has to move around with such haste, but all I want to do is stop. I just want to appreciate the colors. I want to laugh. I want to be happy. But in this world, you *can't* be happy looking at the colors. &amp;nbsp; *You just.. can't.*"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several key indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a lack of interest or emotional investment in their new job, despite it being a good opportunity with potential for advancement. They mention not having an endgame or goal in life, indicating a lack of purpose or motivation. The poster also describes feeling ""very passive depression"" and being exhausted by the overwhelming ""noise"" and fast-paced nature of the world. They express a longing to appreciate simple pleasures and be happy, but feel trapped in a world that doesn't allow for it. The overall tone of the post is one of lethargy, apathy, and a desperate desire for a different, more peaceful existence, which aligns with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: My father may have been a monster after all... I’ll try to make this as short as I can I am a 32/F both my parents have passed my mom as recently as 12/2016. My father was up in age when I was born. My mom was wife number 5 and much younger. So when he passed in 2013 it was sad but he lived till his nineties. My parents each had two kids from previous marriages that are much older then me. My mom got sick and then was dying for a year. I was her caregiver 100% and she lived with me. I worked two jobs had no days off and was a P/T nanny as well. Which made her so happy to have in the house cause she loved babies. My bro and sister are human garbage. They did nothing for her when she was dying, made life horrible for me, disliked my care for her just all around horrible people who pushed me to the brink of suicide. I cut all ties when she died moved to another part of the state and got a promotion. I’m doing alright now and it’s only been a little over a year. So now I had a brother from my dads marriage but he died in a car wreck in 07. My sister from my dads side is all the family I have left. I love her dearly but she has mental issues that are severe. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. We live in different states and I tried to get her to move to my state and she Wont she likes where she is. She lives independently and goes to a day program so she manages ok. Recently she has been upset at my cutting ties with my half siblings her step siblings. I told her I would have no problem with her continuing contact but I would not. Hell my cunt of a shitty sister tried to borrow money from her the majority of the times she called her but still I can’t stop her she is a 50yr old woman. But now my fragile sister is starting to not do well she is recalling abuse from when she was a teen. Gang rape at 13 multiple rapes in high school etc. and she said our dad did nothing and noticed nothing Now I know this could be her illness at play but....I think I believe her. She got sick or I should say her schizophrenia came to the front lines in her early 20s after she graduated college and had a pretty damn good job. I wasn’t even born yet but my mom was in the picture. (My mom and her were very close) When my sister had her breakdown she described horrible rape and abuse in the middle of delusions and episodes. My mom said my dad thought it was her sickness but as my mom put it the way she described it happening it originated somewhere. Whether delusions morphed her memories my mom thought it happened to her. So now this sister only has me to vent to. I tried to call her case manager but as she is an adult and hasn’t been hospitalized in decades she won’t let me speak to her. I’m going to call her day program and try to speak to someone about her seeing a rape counselor or something along wit her regular treatment. In a way I don’t want to deal with something this heavy again and I know that’s selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity And then there is the fact that I think my father did do nothing. I was his favorite and I know I was. He never hit me and my mom but he was verbally abusive. But he favorited me cause I am the most like him. He valued education and ambition and I think he felt my sister failed him being sick along with my brother. He acted as a father and I have good memories of him but he wasn’t exactly a emotional or loving person to my mom or at times me. But I guess I got the little he had in him. Now I’m starting to wonder if he was a sociopath or fuck a damn monster. After my brother who would be said sisters full brother died in what we thought was a regular car accident I found out it wasn’t. He was on pills and had an addiction and was telling people this shit will kill me. And from the police report witnesses state he just veered into a pole never hit anyone or anything. Just went into a tree. My fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different? While I pulled myself out of the hole I thought I was in, I haven’t done well in dating or making friends in my new city. before my parents illnesses I was good at it. I’m afraid I’m doing ok with all these losses because I am like him. Through my job I’m booking sessions with a therapist but im still scared to pick up the phone when my sister calls I know I sound really selfish"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post clearly exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a history of caregiving for their sick mother and experiencing emotional distress due to the lack of support from their siblings. They express feelings of being pushed to the brink of suicide and experiencing a loss of self-identity and social connections. The mention of their fragile sister recalling past abuse and the poster's own doubts about their father's actions further contributes to their emotional distress. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-blame, fear, and guilt aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I will end my life, sooner or later I’ve never felt more lost in my life. I have no idea what I’m doing with myself. I don’t even know how to explain how bad my mental health is .. I’ve made so many attempts to tell my parents how bad I’ve gotten, and all my mom tells me is that she’ll make an appointment for me to get diagnosed w/ depression, bipolar and anxiety so I can get the medication I need but she lies. She’s been telling me this for months .. I want to kill myself, because at least then everyone will show me the love I’ve always wanted. “When I die you’ll love me.”"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays clear indications of severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of being lost and having no direction in life, as well as struggling with their mental health.

The overall tone of the post conveys a deep emotional pain and a belief that death is the only way to receive the love they desire, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
Post: Body: Anterior pelvic tilt So i have APT and im really skinny and its been fucking ruining my life. For more than 1 year ive always thought about my body and i obesses over it. Ive been going to the gym now for 1 month of personal training and not a single difference at all. Not a tiny bit fitter not a tiny bit stronger or anything. Im so fucking depressed.

My back is like an S shape.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post portrays a high level of self-esteem issues, frustration, and despair. The poster describes how their physique has been ""ruining"" their life and how they obsess over their body. The lack of progress at the gym despite consistent effort contributes to their feelings of depression. The comparison to others and the perception that ""everyones [sic] a fucking bodybuilder"" further indicates a deep sense of despair and inadequacy. The statement ""It's been killing me"" strongly suggests that the poster is experiencing significant emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: My friend is making me extremely uncomfortable lately. Should I remove them from my life? I’m a teenager and I have a online friend that had been making me uncomfortable lately. She asked me to call her at about 12am because she was afraid of the thunderstorm she heard and when we got on the phone she started flirting with me. I passed it off as playfulness as she has a boyfriend but she continued. She started moaning my name over and over and exposed one of her breasts. When I asked her why she said it was ‘cute how I reacted and funny’. I have no interest in her at all and I expressed this; she apologised over text but I’m still very uncomfortable talking to her. What should I do?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not show clear indicators of depression. While the poster describes feeling uncomfortable and unsure about how to handle a situation with their online friend, there is no mention of overwhelming emotional distress or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post is more focused on seeking advice and guidance in dealing with a specific interpersonal issue rather than expressing a deep emotional struggle."
Post: Dealing with a narcissistic mother Ok. I live at home after graduating from college with my mom because I'm in the process of planning my career and finding a job to move out eventually. The thing is its like being in hell when you have a mother with clear mental problems bullying you all the time. She constantly needs attention and if she doesn't get it she changes the locks or threatens me with an eviction notice or tries to remove all the food from the house knowing I don't have anywhere to go and I'm doing all I can as fast as I possibly can to move out. I don't eat much because even if I consume a dollar to 4 dollars worth of food a week she still says I'm eating her out of house and home. I work on my portfolio from sunrise to sunset daily so I'm in my room 90 percent of the time but she accuses me of being secretive because she can't know every little thing I do. She doesn't believe in boundaries and my mental health has suffered greatly because of it. It is now to the point where I've become severely suicidal at times because I feel as if every step I take to start my life away from here she pulls me back 5. What should I do? I have no where else to live or go.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post describes a highly distressing and toxic living situation with a narcissistic mother. The poster expresses being constantly bullied, threatened, and manipulated by their mother, causing significant emotional distress. The mention of feeling severely suicidal indicates a deep level of despair and hopelessness. The lack of support, options, and feeling trapped suggest a severe impact on the poster's mental health. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
Post: A romantic relationship doesn't cure depression. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. Bye.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates a belief that a romantic relationship is not capable of resolving or alleviating depression. While it does not explicitly express personal emotions or experiences, the mention of depression in relation to relationships suggests a level of personal familiarity with the topic. This could indicate that the poster has struggled with depression and has learned from their own experiences or observed the experiences of others. The overall tone of the post is concise and potentially detached, which aligns with the emotional numbness commonly associated with depression."
"Post: My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce. I have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that. He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially. Any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help? I know it's gotta be on his terms and everything, but I don't know what else to do. Thanks!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on the poster's concerns about their father's alcohol consumption and the potential impact it may have on their family. While there is mention of the father possibly being depressed and refusing to seek help, the overall tone of the post does not strongly convey the emotional distress typically associated with very severe depression. The poster expresses care and concern for their father's well-being and is seeking advice on how to approach the situation, showing a pragmatism and a willingness to take action. However, it is important to note that the father's potential depression could still be a valid concern and should be addressed, but it does not appear to be the main focus of the post."
"Post: Just got on anti-deppresants a couple of days ago and I just feel like something is wrong. I dont feel better or worse but i just feel weird like something is off, is this normal to feel i havent had any other major side effects exept slight nausea?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post mentions that the person has recently started taking antidepressants and expresses a feeling of something being ""off"" or abnormal. Additionally, the post mentions experiencing slight nausea, which can be a common side effect of starting antidepressant medication. This indicates that the person is seeking reassurance and validation for their experience. The post does not mention any profound emotional distress or symptoms of severe depression. Therefore, the label of ""no"" for depression is appropriate in this case."
"Post: Despair is the normal state of my life I haven't drank though. I have no urge to drink. I just want to stop. Stop moving. Just end. I keep picturing myself walking out on my job. Getting kicked out of my apartment. Living in my car. That being repossessed. And eventually ending up in a gutter, wrapped in a a blanket but still freezing to death. Just frozen. Not moving, not willing and thus not physically able to bring myself to it. There is no point to it. It's never enough. Not matter how much you work, how hard you try, it doesn't work. I don't get ahead. Everything I am, someone is better at it. And anything I do, I can be replaced. And if I do find success by some small measure, I acclimate and find myself just as miserable. Nothing has changed. I did a long big post a few weeks ago about all the supposed progress I made. It doesn't bring me happiness anymore. I am so fucking far behind I will never get to a place where I feel safe, so fuck it. I just want to exit. I am sick of being a cog in a machine I never wanted to help built or run. Life is just work, sleep, and distract. I am not sure why I am writing it. I don't know how I found the motivation."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys intense feelings of despair, hopelessness, and a desire to end one's life. The poster describes a lack of motivation, a sense of being stuck in a never-ending cycle of work and unhappiness, and a belief that they will never be able to achieve a sense of safety or fulfillment. The mention of picturing a bleak future, feeling replaceable, and the lack of enjoyment from previous progress are all indicators of deep emotional distress that align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post expresses a profound sense of despair and a lack of hope for the future."
"Post: Officially not depressed I have been discharged by my counselor as I am officially not depressed. My suicidal desires are to do with my shit life, not depression. That's a relief then!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has been discharged by their counselor and is no longer officially diagnosed with depression. However, they mention having suicidal desires due to their ""shit life."" This suggests that while they may not currently meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, they are still experiencing significant emotional distress and thoughts of self-harm. The mention of relief may also imply a sense of resignation or acceptance of their current circumstances, which can be indicative of depression. Overall, this post suggests that the poster is still struggling with their emotional well-being, albeit without an official diagnosis of depression."
"Post: I lost my father to a sudden and completely unexpected heart attack two weeks ago. I've been up and down, but right now I'm at a loss. What are some strategies you'd employ(secular wise, i'm non religious). I suffer from severe anxiety(GAD) and severe depression. xpost /r/griefsupport I'm going to seek counselling by the way very soon. My Dad's service hasn't happened yet. I was planning after that to start up again but with this added part. So yeah, my dad showing no signs of it, had a massive heart attack on the 14th and passed away on the 16th at 73 years old. I realize people's times do come, and he had health problems(As far as we knew, no heart disease, had been checked out) but he didn't smoke or drink and he lost a lot of weight and took care of himself for the most part. He was slowing down, but no more then an older person would. To say it was a shock would be putting it mildly. I ugly cried in front of him and his hospital bed several times. I'm just so broken up for my mom and my family. Of course, me too. But my Mom and Dad were married for 45 years. And although it wasn't perfect, they had a true love. And I have such a close relationship with my mother. So when her heart is breaking it's hard for me to see. I sponge it. I feel that pain. I've also unfortunately had to deal with siblings who are dealing with this tragedy by lashing out and trying to put themselves ahead of myself and my brother. (My sister and other brother). And that's been super difficult. They've said some ugly things that I'm trying to look past at the current moment. Anyways, I just wanted to know other then counselling, if there's anything you feel that might be of use to me and my brain to move forward without Dad. Depression has creeped in the last few days with the grief to give it a double whammy. Also had a massive panic attack yesterday as well, which I expected but it never prepares you for it. Anyways. Thank you. Sorry if I seem scrambled. Obviously it's an overload of processing."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a deep sense of grief and loss after unexpectedly losing their father to a heart attack. They mention experiencing ups and downs, but currently feeling at a loss and seeking strategies to cope with their severe anxiety and depression.

The poster also mentions experiencing ugly crying, feeling broken up for their mother and family, and describing their close relationship with their mother. The mention of depression creeping in and experiencing a massive panic attack indicates a worsening of their emotional state. Overall, the post displays a high level of emotional pain, sadness, and distress, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Fuck my father!!

"Post: I’ve completed step one I’m killing myself this year. Not sure when, but I’m really hoping I can make it happen. Last week, I had a wild night in the shower with a lot of vodka and a razor, posted one last snap on my story with a waving emoji, then went full white noise. No snapchat, no instagram, no Facebook, nothing. Broke all my streaks. Now I have no contact with anyone at all. I avoid the people I know at meal times. I stay in my room and game, or start the long list of letters I have to write to people. The sad thing is, I could have been dead almost a week and no one would know. No one has come to my room to check on me, or message me to ask if I’m ok. No ones seen or heard from me in days. I’ve pushed everyone away. Step 1 is complete."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong indicators of very severe depression.

This language and behavior align closely with the symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation."
"Post: Call me Mrs. Self-Destruction Everything I do is wrong. I was given every advantage in life: intelligence, compassion, athleticism, even looks. I have spent the last 11 years (since 15) sabotaging my own success. I'm now in full self-destruct mode. No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't. My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse. I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it. What do I even do? I'm withdrawing from stims myself, and I feel completely useless and hopeless. I'm too lazy to be suicidal these days, but I don't enjoy life anymore. I cry all the time. I live in my head. I don't know what I can gain from posting here, but someone... please help."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes themselves as Mrs. Self-Destruction and expresses a deep sense of self-blame and feelings of failure.

The mention of no anti-depressants working and the desire not to be stuck on stimulants suggests a prolonged struggle with finding effective treatment. The poster also mentions their husband being an addict and going through withdrawal, which adds to their emotional distress. The overall tone of hopelessness, lack of motivation, self-love, and enjoyment of life, as well as frequent crying and living in their head, aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The mention of needing help and feeling completely useless further highlights their emotional distress."
Post: People think I just want attention if I bring my depression up What is the point and why is wanting attention so bad anyway? Who would not want to be told that they matter and that everything will be fine? If I wanted attention so badly why would I pretend to be depressed? Why not just make up a happy story about my day instead of risking sounding like a psychopath?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of frustration and confusion regarding the perception of seeking attention when talking about depression. The poster questions why wanting attention is seen as a negative thing and expresses a desire to be told that they matter and that everything will be fine. These thoughts and emotions suggest a lack of support from others and a possible feeling of isolation. The mention of pretending to be depressed, rather than creating a happy story, suggests a deeper need for understanding and validation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, specifically feelings of worthlessness, isolation, and a desire for validation."

"Post: My dad is about to be 65. I'm scared suddenly at the age, and I'm sad because the last few years I wasted and didn't see him enough. He's a very healthy, smart person. Do I still have quality years for us to do activities together? Wondering if anyone can tell me it's all going to be okay in the sense that 65 is not that old, and that I still have time to make memories and learn from my dad at his age. I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again. I just want 65 onwards for him and us to be quality bonding time."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Alienating family Do you ever get tired of saying you're okay when you're not but you don't want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what's going on with you. My family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we're not a support system and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I'll be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away. The only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that's a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It's a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances (whatever normal is) but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period. Eventually that only person is going to get tired of it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of depression. The poster expresses a feeling of emotional fatigue and hiding their true feelings from their family, which can be a sign of emotional pain and exhaustion commonly associated with depression.

"Post: The days are manageable; it's the years that get me Day to day, aside from the struggle with getting out of bed, I can do OK. Put the mask on, survive the day, go home, go back to sleep (I guess I'm what they call high-functioning). The idea that I'm going to have to do this forever until I die makes me want to move that date up a bit."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of despair and hopelessness about the future, specifically feeling overwhelmed by the idea of having to continue living in the same way every day until death. The mention of struggling to get out of bed and the use of a ""mask"" to function suggests the poster is putting on a facade to appear ""okay"" to others while internally struggling. The desire to ""move that date up a bit"" indicates a significant level of emotional distress and potential suicidal ideation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly a more severe form."

I don't want to confront her because either she'll get upset, or she'll just say 'it was a mistake.' yet somehow i don't believe it was and I want to know what I did wrong."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Help: ruining my University course Second year student here in a UK university. I hardly tried at all in the first year, got generally bad grades on my coursework, but revised just enough for the exams to get a 2:1, which is second from the best grade. I also had a few weeks of socialising separated by many weeks of pretty much self-imposed (and lack of sleep imposed) loneliness. So at the time I felt terrible, but looking back on it from second year I had some good memories. Now I'm missing half the lectures, sometimes I don't even go to the shops to get food for the day and have a terrible diet, miss enormous amounts of sleep, and haven't done any work at all. I'm already failing, and even with resits I have to get a ridiculous mark on my tests this semester to even stand a chance of a worthy final score after the 3rd year is over. I feel like the only thing that's gonna bring me out of the depression is the pride of getting a good grade, but I'm way too pessimistic right now to believe that deep down I can even do it. I'm convinced that only 2 friends like me, 1 pities me, and their friends just mock me stealthily. Paid for societies but don't go to any. Feel like a huge disappointment to my family tbh."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I'm still obsessed with her. At the start of the year, I made a post talking about how I've been obsessed with an older girl for well over a year. Of course, nothing's changed. I watched a video of her earlier. Happy and giddy with excitement. She jumped around and kicked her legs, unable to contain her excitement. She was so happy and full of enjoyment.

Knowing I'll never be with her, whilst she lives out her life happy and free makes me feel down to no end. I'm so miserable, I can't even describe it. Why am I even here?

"Post: It's extremely difficult for me to cry. I used to deal with depression through breaking down and crying at night, and it was a really helpful way to out all the negative emotion, and I always felt much better after. For over a year now, it's been extremely difficult for me to cry. Unless I'm pushed to the absolute edge, when I feel like I should be crying it's more just a feeling of emptiness. This means that I feel like I can never release my feelings, and that it feels really greyscale at times, and on the rare occasions I can cry it hardly helps as it's basically a panic attack at that point.

It's bad enough that I don't like the age difference... (they look the same age and act like the same age, they just aren't the same age) I did tell her she could go once she turns 18.

"Post: How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend? HI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me So this is the situation: My friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. The problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. So this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. I understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays emotional distress and frustration related to the friendship dynamic and the friend's actions.

"Post: Uneasy family members I have had a rough and lonely childhood, in fact i do not want to remember my childhood. There used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad. My mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now. She behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house, behaves as though we are a burden for her. My dad is no angel either, he is arrogant and adamant, impatient and often has anger control problems, never felt close to him when a child and even now. Never felt any love towards my parent, I always had thoughts about running away from them.

My father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look, he doesn't spare men either calling them names based on their physical features. I am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible.There is no room for opinion in my family, especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions. He does not spare me insulting in front of other people. I don't feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them.

Post: Suppose you also have a teenage daughter My daughter is quite often seen on the phone with her friend since she has her first smartphone. She get used to locking her bedroom when she is out.

"Post: I need to get my life on track Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a profound sense of hopelessness, self-doubt, and low self-esteem. They describe feeling depressed for a significant portion of the past 4-6 years and express feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy in various aspects of their life, including socializing, relationships, career, and personal appearance. The post also mentions self-destructive behaviors such as lying to others, avoiding phone calls, and isolating themselves. The lack of motivation to improve their life and the self-awareness of their negative behaviors further suggest the presence of depression. The overall tone of the post conveys a deep sense of despair and the need for a significant change, indicating a significant level of emotional distress often associated with depression."
"Post: Should I reach out to her or leave it alone? (TL;DR) I had a friend and it ended pretty bad IMO. I’ve really missed her over the past couple years and I thought about re-befriending her but I’m not sure. I’ll start with the good things about our past friendship: -she was pretty sweet to me. Very supportive of most things. -She stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a 2 foot bright orange Mohawk. -She tried to keep me from dating a pretty Toxic boy (but at the time I was young and wouldn’t listen) -She made me walk around the entire town with her frequently (helped me lose the weight I’d gained and build some muscle in my legs) -She was for the most part a great friend Now the bad: -since I didn’t listen about Toxic boy, we ended up dating for about 4 years. He’s said he didn’t like her cause when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie. Now while I’m not gonna go into the semantics of whether or not it was s. Assault in anyway, I will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we didn’t accept her apology and to “fuck off” -She borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time, those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when I was young. When I wanted them back she claimed she couldn’t find them. Almost a year went by of her “looking” for them, and I told her (mostly from Toxic boy pushing me to) if she didn’t find them by the end of the week I was going to call the police and report her for stealing them. She gave them back to me a couple days later (scratched, though I don’t know if she knew they were scratched) -I also shortly dated, and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year (our personalities didn’t really mix well) but I don’t think she holds it against me The manority of us breaking up was due to Toxic Boy (he’s he was toxic, he tried to fuck literally any girl friend I introduced him to) pushing me into breaking up with her, telling me she was the toxic one cause she didn’t support our relationship and cause of the juvie thing from years before. In 2015 she reached out to me on Facebook saying: “Hey i know your probably the last person you wanna hear from but, i just wanted to say im sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school. If you don't wanna be friends thats understandable, just know thats not me anymore, and im sorry” Which, of course, Toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died. So I need a second, strangers, opinion. What do I do? *TL;DR: Toxic (now ex) boyfriend made me ditch abrasive friend, do I rekindle friendship?*"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post provides a detailed account of a past friendship and the reasons why the poster is considering rekindling the friendship. While there are some negative aspects mentioned, such as the friend's involvement with a toxic boyfriend and borrowing and potentially damaging the poster's belongings, there is no strong indication of severe emotional distress or symptoms of depression.

"Post: Red-pilling my son Little background, I have two ""sons"" (both Eurasians) one is just about to turn 18 and one has just started high school (13) He is into stuff I would consider for lack of a better word ""Beta"" his interests include puppets and Lego, I've tried to takes these things off him and force him to enjoy some more grown up things but my ""wife"" keeps giving them back. So I know he's going to struggle with women in high-school because he is super beta and will definitely put them off with his interests and his racial condition. So I'm asking if their are any fathers who have ""red-pilled"" their children about women and what the best process of introducing red-pill philosophy and sexual strategies to my beta ""son"" I am thinking he's the right age as now he is beginning to notice girls, I bought him some nudie mags and I know he's been checking them out if you know what I mean, so I definitely think the time is right to give him the red-pill! Thanks -Magnus"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post displays problematic and harmful attitudes towards women and race, suggesting a lack of empathy and understanding.

"Post: Is it okay to be tired of pretending everything is okay to spark optimism? So I have alot going on in my life -- too much for me to want to spend five hours writing about it for this post. What's bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I'm receding into myself because I don't have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I'm tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I've been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I'm so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I'm tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it won't. ""Faking it till you make it"" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It's idiotic. It's not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I'm working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one. &amp;nbsp; But I'm just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I'm working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I'm ""pushing myself on others"" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to ""perk up"" because It's ""what they do when things are hard"" when their ""hard"" is ""I stayed up all the time in college to study and it's hard"" vs ""I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that isn't even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers"". &amp;nbsp; I also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He's somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he's usually hyper optimistic and it's exhausting. We've gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I wasn't immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I'm crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn... It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he'd get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, ""I just don't care to be optimistic. I don't give a fuck. What's that going to do? I'm already tired, it's just going to make me more tired"" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he's just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I don't think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I'm still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just didn't see the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I'm so upset that I don't have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That's stupid. I feel bad, but that's stupid."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feeling overwhelmed and weighed down by various issues in their life, including past abuse and current struggles with poverty.

"Post: I'm gonna die a virgin. No one likes me and I have no friends. My masculinity, self-esteem, and sense of self-worth have been destroyed thoroughly and are simply nonexistent anymore. I don't even bother trying anymore, I just wallow in my own sadness and escapist entertainment trying to find a reason to continue living with the fact that I'm worthless. No woman would ever be into me and I'm gonna die a virgin. I can't even find solace in masturbation because whenever I see any sort of porn I go deep into a depression again because seeing two people enjoying each other makes me envious.

"Post: Does anyone else have friends that act like they like you but never text you to hang out or see how you’re doing? I don’t have a single friend who will text me to hang out. I always have to start the conversation. Every time we hang out though people seem to enjoy my presence. I don’t get it why does no one like me, it feels like everyone is just acting nice but secretly hates me. I try and tell my friends to hang out after a rough week and a breakup, and I just got blown off entirely. I’m really at a loss because no one gives a shit. Edit: For example I texted a friend of mine i’ve known since elementary school if he wanted to hang out. He said sure and he would text me later. He never did. I told literally one of my best friends I’d been having a rough week and wanted to hang out. He blew me off to hang out with someone else. I really can’t handle it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reflects a deep sense of loneliness, rejection, and self-doubt. The poster expresses feelings of being unliked, misunderstood, and ignored by their friends.

"Post: I dare you guys to figure this out. So I met rhis girl during fall semester for college. We found out that we went to the same school as each other, but she is a couple of years younger than me so we never really met before until summer. So we started hanging out after class, and a few times on the weekends. She has always had some what of a communication problem and depression problem. However before i knew that there was a tjme where i messaged her and she hadn't responded and a couple of weeks had gone by. I was thinking that I was annoying her. So i told her we shouldn't bftiends anymore. Later finding out that she had communication issues. She literally has like no friends at all which i genuinely believe. Eventually we see each other in public, afterwards i message her and apologize, and wanting to befriends again. She eventually accepts my apology and we're somewhat on good terms. We eventaully hang out in person again and she is talking to me about how her boyfriend never talks to her and that her dad is being mean to her. So i give her the advice that idk her boyfriend but he could possibly be cheating on you if stops communicating as much woth you. But, again stressing idk know him so take what i said with a grain of salt. Weeks go by and she evetnually tells me that our friendshup isn't going to work out, and that nothing good has really came of it. And i should just stkp trying to be friends. This really hurt me i care about her a great deal. She then proceeds to unfriend me on facebook, and snapchat, and tells me to not contact her anymore. I need some helps guys, i feel like i should give het somr space and time to cool down and then i should message her apologizing for everything and that i want to be friends again.

"Post: 10 years I've been managing depression and I was doing well, until last Monday. Quick back story: 38/m/Ireland. I was a competitive Powerlifter and represented my country on 2 occasions with great success. My life was lifting; setting goals, reaching targets, smashing PBs...all helped with creating a future for myself. I started to feel unwell around December 2016 and developed a persistent, non-productive cough. Series of tests led me to an echocardiograph where it was discovered I was suffering Heart Failure. Dilated Cardio Myopathy caused by a viral infection, left my hearts function at 20%EF. Apparently I had a few months to live if I hadn't caught it. Ironically, now, I wish they hadn't discovered it. My world flipped upside down. No Powerlifting, no excessive exercise, restricted fluid intake, no over exertion, meds for the rest of my life, regular reviews in my heart clinic, multiple ambulance emergency rides to A&amp;E when my heart goes irregular. Hospital, pharmacy, hospital, pharmacy... Seems to be my life for the past year. Last Monday I snapped. It hit me. Everything I lost came crashing in on me. I got in my car, picked a place I knew well to ram my car into at 120mph. I was screaming at myself to do it. My left hand steering towards the end, my right hand steering me to survive. An image of my dog in my mind kept me on the road. I knew she'd miss me too much. I'm still very low now despite all my meds. I still wish I had gone through with it. I still think of going to the Cliffs of Moher and jumping... What a beautiful place to end it. I'm dreading the road ahead because I know how Rocky it's going to be...

"Post: Friends? Hi Reddit, so I recently moved to a new town (and by recently I mean about a year ago) and everything has been alright but I have a really hard time making friends. I'm pretty awkward and I'm just naturally awkward around everyone. I managed to get a best-friend, but its more like he adopted me to be his friend and I got the balls to get a girlfriend who I've been with for about 10 months now. I even got somewhat of a friend group but I'm always awkward around any of them when I'm just with them. so, what i'm trying to say I guess is that I'm wondering if ya'll could give me advice on how not to be awkward or how to get people to enjoy/embrace my awkwardness. I don't know man, I just want friends lol. Thanks guys &lt;3"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?) A friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don't have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes. I really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn't have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn't answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said ""I can't do this"". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn't true friendship if she wouldn't reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether. I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation. I still do care about her as a person. I don't think she's evil but I do think that she doesn't have much compassion for me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I think I'm having a nervous breakdown I've struggled off and on for about 10 years with anxiety and depression. The latter half has been mostly on. Recently my psychiatrist changed my medication from Zoloft to Effexor because the Zoloft had pretty much plateaued and then started working less. I don't think the Effexor is having a very good effect on me. My depression has been worse than ever. On top of that I found out that my dog has bone cancer and likely won't live more than 8-12 months. She's only 6 and she has been my entire world since I adopted her and she has helped me through a lot of difficult times. Because of these things my moods have been very bad, and I had to leave work a few days ago and I haven't been back since, and I'm pretty sure they're going to fire me because I'm still new. Although the job was adding to my stress because they failed to tell me that we would be working mandatory overtime EVERY SINGLE DAY. I don't have much of a support system. My mom is pissed at me about work, and I'm living with my grandfather who just doesn't get it. I don't really have much in the way of friends which is I guess why I'm ranting on Reddit looking for some kind of support. I don't really know what to do. I'm going to call my psychiatrist Monday to set up an appointment and hopefully get off Effexor. I want to find a job that is less intense than this one, and less hours. Hopefully part time.

"Post: How should I deal with this flaky friend? I have a friend who I totally love who ALWAYS flakes. whether the plans are big or small 95% of the plans we make (initiated by her often) end up with ""I don't feel like going out"" or ""i made other plans"" or ""i don't remember making these plans"" etc. This is super annoying and all but it's not the whole problem. Since she's super flaky I always call her out on it or joke about it. for example: In our group chat another friend will make plans and she'll be like ""ok its set"" and then i'll reply like ""that only means it's half set"" and I know I'm being snarky and all but she deserves it for being such a flake! right? Anyway I guess it really annoys her when i do this so she confronted me about it calling me a bitch for always making jokes about her being flaky and asked me not to do it anymore. I agreed but I kind of wish I didn't and now i feel like not even replying when we talk in our group chat. Im sure making snarky comments about someone being a flake can't be anywhere near as annoying as constantly being flaked on, Right? There's been some huge plans that she flaked on including travel and birthday plans that really upset me especially since she's such a good friend and it means a lot to me for her to make it to those special occasions.

"Post: Rolling down hill Hi all, It all started last year when I quit my bachelor in Physical Therapy. That study didnt seem right for me and I dropped out in feb 2016. From februari till september I've worked a depressing job in an order picking centre to pay for my next year of college. But after that there wasnt any motivation for anything left over in me. This year I started a new study, lifesciences. It started all fun for the first two months. Because we had the basics of chemistry, anatomy, algebra and physics. But in the beginning of november the second semester started and thus I had tests from the first semester. Failed them all. In the weeks leading to the tests I couldnt concentrate or motivate myself to do anything. I was just at my room doing absolutely nothing. 14 november was my birthday, turned 19. Everyone forgot it except my gf (for 2,5 years). Was a fun day and made me forget the test results and gave me a little hope. Today she told me she was seeing someone else for the last 3 months because I had too little time to see her, because I was always busy with school. Im feeling that everything is worse. My job sucks but I have to keep it as I got to keep up with school costs. Already got pretty hefty debt from those two halve years of university. I just feel that everything that I do fails. Like the last 2 years I've accomplished nothing. I would like to travel if I'm going to have my second gap year but my funds wouldnt allow it. Working would be my only option but the only jobs that are available will push me over the edge. But there is something good at the horizon; there is a small chance I'm getting accepted in to the police academy, but that's only a small chance so no big hopes as that makes it worse."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: It’s not some fucking sadness anymore. This is madness. I remember when I just had a few days when I felt sad and out of it. And I would worry but then everything became better a few days later. Still, I went to a psychologist, because my downs were too consistent to be considered normal. It all went downhill from there. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I’m not “there”, like I’ve lost control of what I say and think. Like I’ve lost my mind. Like others are normal and I’m in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I’m completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others don’t work for me. I hate it. It’s not just a “bad mood” anymore. It’s feeling like I’ve lost my way, and there’s no signs to get back. Like a loop I can’t get out of. That’s why suicide comes up as an option. When you’re stuck in a loop, the only solution is to shut off. If sleeping is the only thing I enjoy, then why won’t I sleep forever?

"Post: Sleeping to avoid hurting myself Sleeping seems like the only way to keep myself from self-harming. I have bipolar 2 (heavy on depression, light on mania), so my depressive episodes always pass. I just feel like sleeping is the only way to stay safe until it does. My therapist uses medication as a last resort, so I’m not medicated. I should be, clearly, but she’s kind of a hippie. I’m not.

"Post: Psychiatrist of 6 years terminated me as a patient and is refusing refills of Lamictal because I went to outpatient rehab? I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years. I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder. I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills. I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal. It wasn't a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I wouldn't relapse back to drinking. My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician. I am freaking out about the effects of stopping this cold turkey. I only took the Ativan for one week, two months ago. I just want to have my lamictal refilled. I need a refill this week, I can't find a new psychiatrist in time. How is this allowed?

"Post: I think I'm in an abusive friendship and I don't know what to do. One of my close friends with borderline has been constantly reinforcing and triggering my social anxiety. Everything is apparently all my fault, always, Apparently everyone (whatever that means) says I'm nuts, Im controlling, blah blah. She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc. I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend.

Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed.

"Post: 21/F/US Looking for a long term friend Hello! My name is Mousey and I live in Georgia. I’ve been very busy with school, work, and starting my own business. I’m looking for people I can have serious connections with. I used to have a best friend in the UK whom I talked with every day all day. So, time zones don’t really bother me. I have an open mind, and I love sharing thoughts and ideas with people. I love learning new things (and since I have an awful memory- you can teach me the same thing three times and I’ll be excited every time lol) I am currently studying to be a middle grades teacher in the fields of science and social sciences. I also have a chinchilla and a hedgehog. They’re wonderful babies and I’ve had them for a long time now (they’re my heart) I am pretty blunt and open to receive and give advice. I really want someone who i can share my daily life with, and they can share theirs with me. Funny pictures, goofing off, hard experiences we encounter, the whole nine. I miss having that connection with someone. I’m not looking for a specific gender, age, or region. I just wanna spend my time and experiences with someone who will become special to me!(: I’m not sure if this helps or hurts me here- but, I’m not really into anime or gaming (I thought I would throw that in there because of the people on here seem to enjoy those things) A lot of people also tend to be into computer science, and that’s okay!

"Post: Not fearing any consequences for our actions? ""Not fearing any consequences or not fearing anything"" is one of the feelings I have observed in myself. I am not able to study well, yet when test comes, I have no fear of the consequences of the failing tests, even though I am certainly failing it. Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night. I know its not healthy, but aren't we supposed to do these things by fearing what will happen to ourselves?

"Post: Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more 'dramatic' than it actually is? I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity. I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It's pretty toxic but it's one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

Counselors who are getting paid to deal with me make me feel like I'm being too annoying. Maybe I'm talking over them too much or I'm too jittery. I feel like people are always trying to dominate me or shut me down. No one has every seemed to seek me out or wanted to be around me. I'm the only person that enjoys my company and that's all I have. I talk to myself a lot. I make myself laugh a lot. This is occurring to me as I'm typing it and I feel like crying. I just want a person I can make laugh and inspire. I want to make a difference in someone else's life."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Lonely and stupid. I feel so stupid. I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts. At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while. I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several indicators of depression. The poster expresses feelings of low self-worth, describing themselves as ""stupid"" and constantly overwhelmed by their perceived lack of intelligence compared to their peers.

"Post: I’m trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it won’t be easy and it may never work, but it’s worth a shot? Long story short: I’ve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I don’t want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it. My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I’ve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became “too high risk” and am not allowed back. And I don’t want to go back. I don’t believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told “your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.” So anyways, I can’t fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions. So here’s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I don’t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It’s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I’ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I’m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to “get my friend back”. That’ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That’s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I’m not asking for money, I’m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I’m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver. Here’s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It’ll start with the channel being named “Ian”, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I’ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything. The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I’ve mentally improved over however long it takes. This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I’m going to attempt anyways. I might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional pain and desperation. The poster describes their struggle with depression and the impact it has had on their friendship.

"Post: These ups and downs are too much for me I finally went to the dr and got a prescription for an AD but I feel like it’s worse than before. My lows are so low. My highs are just feeling normal. I’ve never seriously thought of suicide before but thoughts creep in my mind now. I can’t sleep. Constantly worried about things in my life. I have no reason to feel this way.

"Post: Husband in hospital and I am at a complete loss Hi all long time lurker first time poster. Using a throw away since it would destroy my husband if he saw this. I am on mobile and a bit sleep deprived, so sorry for the format or dreaded grammar errors. TLDR at bottom. Honestly I don’t need advice I just need to let everything out now before i explode. And (un)fortunately my husband is my best friend leaving me feeling alone with no one to talk to. I have a 20month old and am 35 weeks pregnant. My husband for the last few weeks has been feeling nauseous and out of sorts. I finally convinced him to go to a redicare. Well those jerks turned him away since they can’t help with abdominal pain. I wasn’t with him or they would have seen him. He ended up going to another urgent care. There they realized he had a bp of 220/112. First annoyance if the first place took his vitals we could have headed straight to the ER. We met up and got him there right away. We were at the ER for several hours before they made the decision to admit him to the cardiac unit of the hospital. Since then they have discovered a kidney issue and have not gotten a handle on the bp. They have no answers but seem to be coming up with more questions. He isn’t even 30 so the fact this is happening is extremely bizarre. His mother was here to help, but I am at my wits end and needed to be alone this evening. We just moved our daughter to a toddler bed Saturday which is doing great at night but she hasn’t napped in 3 days. She is crabby and obviously confused since daddy isn’t home. She is also in a phase where hitting mommy is funny. She hit me today and I just burst into tears. Which according to my mil is my hormones which really helped the situation. I can’t sleep and am vomiting from pregnancy and stress. I know I have to be strong for her and him and unborn, but I am failing. I spent 2 hours tonight just crying. I keep losing my temper with my daughter. I wish I could be at the hospital with him. I feel stranded, alone and useless. I don’t know how I can help him. He is spiraling down into a pit of depression and I have no way of helping him out. I keep calling and texting him which I can tell he doesn’t want. We are going to visit tomorrow morning then my mom is going to come here tomorrow so I can go see him again without the little one. But I haven’t been home much the past 2 days and I know it is taking a toll on her. I just recently became a stay at home which has created separation anxiety issues. I feel torn between to 2 people who mean the world to me and I am failing both of them. If you made it this far I guess the only question I have is does anyone have experience with this and how can I help him and her get through this? TLDR: Husband has crazy high bp and hospitalized. I feel like I am failing helping him and my toddler get through this. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Being 35 weeks pregnant is not making anything easier."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits clear emotional distress and a sense of overwhelm, which are common in depression. The poster describes feeling alone, useless, and like a failure in supporting both her husband and toddler. She expresses feelings of being stranded and useless, and describes crying for hours and losing her temper with her daughter.

"Post: I feel like I get disrespected sometimes by my mom and brother. I [21f] live at home with my parents [58m&amp;52f] and my older brother [25m]. Every time I'm in the bathroom emptying my bladder and my mom has to go, and she rushes me to finish. It's not like I can't pee any faster, I swear my mom and brother are the only ones in the house who can be rude to me sometimes. When my brother plays his game and I want to tell him about something he gives me an attitude just because he's mad at the game since he sucks at video games (I don't know why he keeps playing the same game that he dies in a lot) or he just plains ignore. I think now I know why I was never happy living at home. A lot of bad things happened to me in the house I grew up in. (it's a long story for another post).I'm more happier away from home than when I'm at home. The only time I feel like I get respected and treated nicely is when I'm with my boyfriend, my best friends, and my other family members. Sadly I can't move out yet since I'm not working at the moment but I'll be working soon and making enough to leave the place I can't even call home most of the time."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I have no friends This isn’t an over dramatic statement. I truly have no friends. Throughout the years I’ve grown a part from people and I’ve distanced myself from people I felt were toxic. I’ve had my heart broken by a few friends. But right now I’m sitting here looking at this funny meme I wanted to share and I realized I have no one to send it to. I hope all of this makes sense one day. Goodnight Edit: Wow, I did not expect this response! It’s comforting to know I am not alone.

"Post: Has anyone actually outgrown their depression or mental health issues? One of my biggest fears is that my depression, anxiety, and personality disorder will either stay with me forever or will increasingly get worse. I truly feel it’s getting worse every year and I feel I will never have a normal life or be successful because of them.

"Post: I miss the days where I at least had depression sleep to look forward to. More of a vent here so bare with me. I have not had a good night of undisturbed deep sleep where I wake up feeling refreshed in years. Like, I kinda autopilot through my day trying to ignore how nothing really excites or motivates me and that I've stopped progressing towards any dreams or goals, and the more I'm awake the longer I have to struggle with that and I don't even have sleep to look forward to. I used to be able to sleep through anything and for many hours at a time. It was awesome.

"Post: I want to pay off my debt then kill myself. I came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments. I've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now. There's nothing to look forward to anymore. 3 years of suffering incoming"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I'm Weakest At Night... I don't understand the reason for this, but for as long as I can remember I've always been weakest during the night time. I feel weak mentally, emotionally, physically, internally... I feel like I can't go on, like I can't keep fighting, like I've had enough... I freeze over, my body locks up, my fear paralyzes me, and my mind becomes my enemy... Night seems endless because I can't see much of anything no matter where I try to look. From minor fears to worst nightmares stalk me like I'm nothing but an insignificant prey who's time has come. I'm exhausted and need sleep, but only nightmares haunt me or the fear of being attacked while I'm immobile by unconsciousness... And yet, though a part of me yearns for light, for the warm comfort of the sun, it only depresses me. In the light I can see what I truly am, I can see a reflection of something I've grown to hate. When I look at my reflection I want to smash the mirror so I can no longer see the truth of my insignificant existence. In the light I can see everyone else, either continuing on with their lives without a thought of me or a second glance. Or I see other people like me suffering and it both hurts and gives me a strange, and possibly, a cruel comfort. I hate seeing other's suffer, but I'm so insignificant I am helpless that I might as well be dead... I need the light and yet it hurts me..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I've been reading this subreddit for awhile. Well, as the title says I have been reading this stuff for months. I think I'm depressed. I'm not sure why though. I have a really good long-term boyfriend, everything I need and a lot of things I just want. I've been ""depressed"" as long as I can remember. I think about killing myself every day, multiple times a day. Like, ""oh, i dropped something, well better kill myself"" ""Oh, I failed that math problem, you're worthless better kill yourself now"" I can barely shower most days. I don't know why my boyfriend hasn't broken up with me. Sometimes I wish he would so I could just kill myself. I feel really bad for him. I have anger issues I think, My moods change really fast, it is hard to keep up with them and I don't know why it happens. Most days I don't want to get out of bed. I don't have any friends. I always feel like everyone hates me. It would just be so much easier to die, why do people bother with life? What is the point? Everyone has always said that things ""get better"" but they don't really. They change and then something else sucks. Nothing makes me happy, I don't enjoy doing anything that I can do by myself. I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I guess I just hate myself. Is this depression? Do I just suck? Maybe I'm just being dramatic. I wanna be a better person but I don't know how. My anxiety feels like a prison. It's really hard for me to leave the house. I HATE being around people, but I don't want to be alone either. Going to the store is a nightmare for me, the panic attacks and worrying I'm in someones way all the time. I only go in the middle of the night and never by myself. What is wrong with me? Why can't I do things normal people do? Is there any point in existing when you always feel miserable? This is the most awkward thing I've done in awhile, Time to take a nap and forget I posted here.

"Post: I don’t even want to write this post I just wish I had the fulfilling family experience like everyone of my other friends did. But instead I got a drug addict mom and a emotional incompetent dad who I regularly got into emotional skirmishes a lot when I was younger. Im the product of verbal abuse and emotional neglect and it haunts to every single day of my life. This affects me in ways like not being productive at all when I get close to deadlines, not being to emotionally relate to anyone because my internet sense of judgement and risk management are fucked up, I have self destructive tendencies that I use as coping mechanisms, I hop on the rollercoaster of life and hope and pray sometimes that it would fling me off the tracks. I don’t even know if any of this makes sense because of the conflicting thoughts I’m always having about whether or not I believe or don’t believe that this life is worth living. I’m trying every single day, I’m trying my hardest to keep it together, I’m trying my absolute fucking hardest to keep moving forward but I am consistently being stopped or held back by the dread and anguish of waking up to a life that I don’t even want to fucking live."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding. Hi. I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down. These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help. What I'm asking: As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help. They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year. Thanks. Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses. I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction. One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal. Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch. Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post portrays a significant emotional impact of the loss of four Marines to depression and almost losing another one to suicide. The poster expresses a deep need for understanding and help in identifying Marines who may be suffering from depression. The mention of the intelligence and humor of the Marines, as well as the lack of outward signs of distress, emphasizes the difficulty in recognizing their struggles. The post conveys a sense of responsibility and desire to be more aware and vigilant in assessing the mental health needs of those under the poster's care. These indicators suggest a significant level of emotional distress and a potential correlation to depression."

"Post: Trying to repair a lost friendship First time poster here so sorry if I don’t explain things very well So a few months ago I went on a trip with my friend and both of our boyfriends. I got a little controlling with the planning of the trip and that caused some tension. And after they went to a party they didn’t want us accompanying them to I got upset and distanced myself a little. This lead to her boyfriend and I having an argument. Where he stated if I weren’t a girl he’d ‘bash me’. After this we haven’t spoken but the friend recently contacted my mother to check in on how she was with some local flooding. This has made me think that she still cares for me, and I still greatly care for her. I’m having trouble approaching how to contact her. And while I know that it was said in anger I feel like I deserve an apology from her boyfriend, or at least reassurance that he won’t ever actually attack me. Is it unreasonable to want an apology from him? Should I let it go? I feel I should also note I do have sever anxiety, that’s why I struggle with situations like these so much."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the post does convey a sense of emotional distress and anxiety. The poster describes a situation where they had a falling out with a friend and their friend's boyfriend made a threatening statement towards them. The fact that the poster is having trouble approaching how to contact their friend suggests a level of anxiety and fear. However, the post does not exhibit the deep sense of hopelessness, despair, or lack of enjoyment typically associated with very severe depression. It primarily focuses on seeking advice and reassurance regarding the situation, which indicates a more specific and situational concern rather than a broader emotional state of depression."
"Post: I ruined all four of my friendships in one stupid move Fucking siblings. Every only child thinks they want one. Everyone with a sibling is annoyed by them, but secretly loves them. Not me. My brother makes me want to kill myself. He's one of the two reasons I'm as fucked up as I am today. And he knows that. That's why he does it. Well, one day, he was being nice to me. It was a less depressing time for me. I was bored. Thought, ya know, why not add my brother to the group chat. Big. Fucking. Mistake. He took the pettiness level through the roof and convinced my friends everything I ever do is a fucking lie. He convinced my friends I'm an asshole who does nothing but pick at him and make up problems all day. I have no friends now I feel so betrayed. Alone. I don't really care about that though. I've realized I'll never be happy. Not while he lives. Any chance I have at happiness he can rip away from me just as easily. What the fuck is the point in living??? I don't think I can do this much longer."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post contains strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses intense anger towards their sibling, describing how their brother is the root cause of their current emotional state.

Reasoning: The post expresses a negative view of the world and a belief that it is unfair, which may be indicative of depressive thinking. However, it also suggests a desire to make a positive impact by becoming a humanitarian and helping others.

The use of smiley faces at the end could also be an attempt to mask or downplay underlying sadness or despair. Overall, the post exhibits signs of depressive thinking but also demonstrates a potential coping strategy."
"Post: Today is my birthday. I mostly spent the day alone. I got a few more “happy birthday” messages than expected so that’s nice I guess. Otherwise, it felt like a normal day, though a bit sadder because I feel like I’m expected to be happy but I’m not. From now on, I’m gonna stop hoping my next birthday will be better like I usually do. It’s just disappointing and depressing."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: A Long Story So here’s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girl’s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online). But what I wouldn’t learn till the following week was that she wasn’t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a “intervention” where the three of them sat me down and told me that NG’s BF old her that She couldn’t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NG’s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didn’t come off that way. The “Intervention” ended with her leaving and me leaving as well. The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done. Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I don’t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they don’t even care about me anymore. I apologize for the long post."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Anyone else feel they are unloveable? TLDR: I feel I have no friends and anybody I get close to leaves I started noticing I was always unhappy and sad in my last year of high school. I didn’t understand the point of life anymore and everyday driving to school I just thought how easy it was to drive off a cliff on the way to school. I got scared and told my parents who helped me get professional help. I confided in my 3 best friends at the time and almost immediately I noticed 2 of them stopped talking to me. The third I’m still friends with but not nearly as close as I used to be. When I went to college, my roommate and I became best friends but a year later, he decided to drop out and leave. I realize this is through no fault of my own but it still sucks losing a best friend. Finally, my 3rd year of college, I met the most amazing woman. With her help, I felt like I finally defeated depression. We dated for 2 years and I was so sure we were gonna last. However, I got a job on the east coast whereas we were both from the west coast. We decided we could last through the distance so I took the job and moved 3000 miles away. She just told me it wasn’t working out and broke up with me. She was my best friend and my girlfriend for 2 years. I never felt a connection with anyone else as strong as I did for her. Now I’m fearing my depression may have come back. I’m thinking I didn’t defeat depression but instead had her to use as a support. I’m here on the east coast of the US and I have no friends or family around me. I don’t know what to do and everyday I just feel like it’s me vs the whole world. I’ve already lost all hope and I feel like I don’t deserve happiness.

Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling unlovable and lacking friends, indicating low self-esteem and potentially feelings of social isolation.

The poster expresses a sense of hopelessness, as well as a lack of support and connection in their current situation on the east coast. The post overall conveys deep emotional pain, despair, and a pervasive feeling of being defeated by life, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: Can depression make you see only the 'negative' aspects of your SO? I don't know what to think anymore. I'm in a relationship and maybe we're just not meant to be. Did depression ever cause you to only see the negative aspects of your SO? Like you thought to yourself: ""His nose looks weird"" or ""I don't like his hair"" or ""His teeth aren't even"". Things that didn't bother you before... Or that you didn't pay attention to but now now you do? I'm so desperate. :("," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

The use of the word ""desperate"" at the end of the post further indicates the level of emotional distress the poster is experiencing."
"Post: I miss my best friend and they miss me I'm 12 and my best friend is 11. We both have the same birthday and were best friends last year. So this year I chose to homeschool for something. And during this year I've barely seen my best friend. I would ask my mom a lot to setup some weekly hang-out with him but it never got to happen.During this time we've found a soccer team to play on together. One practice, we got to talk after. During this chat he mentioned him always asking his mom to let me come to his house. I stated I did the same thing. That night it made me glad he wanted to hang out with me all the time. About 5 days later I realized what this chat meant. Really when he stated that he asked his mom about me coming over a lot, he was practically saying he missed me. And when I stated the same thing back I was saying the same thing. I learned it was a test of friendship from him, and that we were both thinking the same thing, missing eachother a lot. Right now, we're both just waiting for a weekly hang-out to happen. During this wait, we're both sad; what's the best thing for me to do when we're waiting? Should I try and talk to him more?

"Post: How do I deal with feeling worthless? I’ve had a bad day and this is on top of just a long few years of my life where I can’t remember the last time I’ve truly been happy. I have a few friends but the more my life has gone on, the more I’ve realized certain dislikings i have towards them. I want to meet new people and do new things, something that my friends aren’t interested in or don’t have time for. I’m as bad as you could imagine when it comes to making new friends because I can be really socially awkward and I’m convinced that few other people share specific interests that I would look for in friends or a girlfriend. I have few (if any) aspirations in life and I just feel like I’m drifting through life without any idea what I want. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished much in my life, I’m in college but I’ve never held a job before and I’m hardly passionate enough about a career to really be interested to want to pursue it.

Long story short, she stopped talking to me and then I stopped talking to her but she thought I was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school. Recently, I texted her saying that I apologize. She said that she'd give me a second chance, so I start texting her questions to get to know her again, but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer, all she says is ""Yes/no, you?"" When I ask her a question and ""Haha ok"" when I answer my own question. She even leaves me on read sometimes. Should I stop texting her? I really don't understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she won't even try to support the conversation.

"Post: Older female fighting depression Hi I’m a 54 year old female that’s recently lost 100 pounds and quit smoking. You think that would solve the depression!

"Post: Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes. This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse. Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide. During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc. In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how. I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems. Anyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won't respond (at least I think so). What should I (or should not) say to her?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes their friend as being constantly depressed, complaining about everything, feeling like a loser, and frequently questioning the meaning of life. The mention of self-hate, suicidal thoughts, and writing about ""nightmares"" and ""thought crimes"" suggests a significant level of emotional distress and hopelessness. The mention of the poster feeling terrified and speechless, as well as seeking advice on how to talk to a depressed friend, further emphasize the severity of the situation.

So there’s that, on top of it, this past week someone I’d consider a close friend was having problems with this guy she’s kinda friends with and something happened and she blocked him and I pestered her about it because I wanted to see if I could help and she got mad at me and stormed off. Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like “This is why nobody likes you” and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I don’t know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit or if I’m caught in the moment but I’ve had a day to think and it still is bugging me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of being put down by friends, feeling excluded and misunderstood. The poster describes a recent incident in which they were criticized and singled out by their friends, leading to feelings of upset and a desire to be included. This suggests a potential lack of social support and negative experiences within their social circle, which can contribute to depressive symptoms. The post also mentions feeling unable to confide in anyone, indicating a potential sense of isolation and difficulty in seeking help or support. These emotional experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: college- medical withdrawal for a semester Okay, so I'm thinking about either doing a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal due to my anxiety and depression. I've already contacted my academic advisor and the financial aid office, but I honestly have no idea whether everything will work out or not. If I manage to get a course load reduction, does anyone have any ideas for things I can do to help myself get better during this semester? If it ends up not working out, does anyone know about other ways I can go about making this semester less stressful? For background, I have a scholarship for tuition for the next two years and I'm terrified as fuck that I'll lose that if I get a course load reduction. Also, my parents basically don't know what mental health is so there's no way I can talk to them about it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is considering a course load reduction or a medical withdrawal from college due to anxiety and depression. This suggests that they are experiencing significant mental health issues that are impacting their ability to handle the stress of college. The mention of being ""terrified as fuck"" and unable to talk to their parents about their mental health suggests a high level of emotional distress and lack of support. The poster also expresses uncertainty about whether everything will work out and seeks advice for ways to help themselves if they do end up with a reduced course load. This combination of anxiety, depression, fear, and lack of support aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression and indicates a significant level of emotional distress."
"Post: [Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it. Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else. I know that in Singapore you're able to consent medically when you're 16, but I'm not sure if i can possible get around her for meds like this without her knowledge/consent. Any help for my situation would be fantastic :) Thanks everyone"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional pain, including a history of depression and serious suicidal thoughts.

"Post: Girl friend pregnant (lgbt) I m a girl My girlfriend is pregnant with a male friend we used as a sperm donor. She did this 1 month after starting dating me but I stayed with her because i like her and I do like kids but now I have no feelings about this. She keeps saying I m not happy to have a baby but I m not having a baby, her and her friend are so no I m not happy, but I m not not happy.

But am I wrong for not being excited saying I m having a baby when in reality I m just the step parent."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post discusses a complex situation regarding the poster's girlfriend being pregnant with a sperm donor while they were only dating for a month. The poster expresses their confusion and lack of excitement about the pregnancy, as they see themselves as a step parent rather than a biological parent. While there may be some emotional challenges and confusion evident in the post, it does not display the severe emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The tone remains relatively calm and focused on the specific issue at hand, rather than expressing overwhelming feelings of despair or hopelessness."
"Post: I can't fucking handle this life How do people do it? I'm supposed to be happy, because I live in Norway, one of the best places to live. How the fuck can I? The thought of all those innocent people murdered just so that the westerners can live comfortably, it just makes me sick. There's no logic to any of this, I'm born into an uncaring and cold world, forced to work my ass of 9-5 every day, just so some corporate asshole can get more money. I earn a fraction of that amount, and then I have to pay some of that to the government. The government then tries to keep me ""safe"", by threatening me with involuntary commitment. They're just trying to keep their livestock in check. We're all just slaves, and no one else seems to understand that. There's this weight on my shoulders, this expectation for me to be something. I can't fucking understand how everyone is okay with this. I want out."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of despair, hopelessness, and anger towards various aspects of life.

"Post: My Friend is Draining Me Apologies, this is a very long post! I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD. She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication. Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems. I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship. The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time. I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country.. Sorry about the long rant and formatting, I’m on my cellphone. TL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her. I have already talked to her about it multiple times, but she always goes back to her old ways."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling drained and emotionally exhausted by their friend's constant focus on her own problems and inability to change her behavior despite multiple conversations. The poster expresses frustration and a sense of being trapped in a one-sided relationship. They also mention that their other mutual friend has cut ties with the friend, suggesting that this pattern of behavior may be negatively impacting multiple relationships. The overall tone of the post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress, hopelessness, and a struggle to maintain their own well-being in the face of their friend's emotional demands, which align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: I can’t decided if I’ve been managing or avoiding my mind and feelings... How is everyone today? For the past two months, I haven’t had a depressive/anxiety episode even though the problems are in the back of my head everyday I wake up. It triggers my anxiety a little because I’m anticipating another one of my relapses. It’s been weeks since I’ve cried or have been stuck in bed (which is good compared to what I’m like usually). But I still don’t feel too inclined to reach out to other people or hang out with them. I don’t feel like dealing with people’s criticisms or judgements of me. I’m just not open to it still...other than that I just feel indifferent/‘Meh’. But is that a good thing? Or should I zip my lips and stop thinking about it :/ some perspective would be nice."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

They mention that they have been relatively stable for the past two months, but express worry and anxiety about the possibility of a relapse. The poster also mentions feeling indifferent and not inclined to reach out to others or deal with potential criticism or judgment. These statements suggest a lack of motivation and social withdrawal, which are common symptoms of depression.

"Post: Not invited to my friend's wedding. Is it time to abandon ship? A guy I have been close friends with for the last 13 years is getting married this year and I've come to the realisation that I'm not invited to the wedding. To be honest, we are not as close as we used to be. We used to hang out all time, but as lives became busy, we spent less time together. I still attend almost all of his social gatherings, though that is probably only 3 to 4 times a year. The weird thing is, I was invited to his engagement party. I got him and his partner a really meaningful gift that they still comment on whenever they see me, yet they didn't invite me the wedding. When I was slightly intoxicated at another friend's girls night some time ago, I asked the bride if invites had been sent out yet because I couldn't remember receiving mine. We then began the awkward exchange in which she told me it was really hard to narrow down the guest list and I realised I was never getting my invite. I tried to act as if I wasn't offended and that I understood, but honestly, I'm really hurt. I've been invited to the hen's night which is in a month. It is not a cheap night. Upwards of $200 for accommodation, games etc. It feels rude to expect me to pay so much to attend a hen's night when they wouldn't even pay for me to be a guest at their wedding. But I also realise that if I don't go to the hen's, it could come across that I don't value the friendship enough to go. What should I do?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of hurt and betrayal. The poster expresses their disappointment in not being invited to a close friend's wedding and feeling hurt by the exclusion. They mention their history of friendship and the meaningful gift they gave to the couple. The poster also raises concerns about attending the expensive hen's night and questioning the value of their friendship.

"Post: bad friend I’ve been friends with this guy for a few months now. At first things were really great and he was a really good friend, but the past two months he’s been a major DICK. I’ve been keeping my distance and not really talking to him as much. I have 3 weeks to either fix this failing friendship or get rid of it. I’ve decided that if it doesn’t get better in the next week, i will spend the following week trying to get rid of this friendship, and the third week dealing with the aftermath. I just don’t know how to, if i need to, end this friendship without being a major dick in return. He’s friends with a lot of people in my friend “network” perse and is even dating one of my best friends, so i want to leave him on good terms as to not cause any problems. advice?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: do therapists tell your parents about you diagnosis? apologies if this isn't a good place to ask. I'm a minor and I'm going to have therapy soon, and I'm very nervous. I likely have social anxiety and have no clue what to say. but besides that, my parents are probably the main reason for my depression, and Id much prefer if they didn't know. does the therapist have to tell them, legally? or by policy or something? will they not if I ask them not to? thank you."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of nervousness and anxiety about upcoming therapy sessions. The mention of social anxiety and depression suggests that the poster may be seeking treatment for mental health issues. The concern about whether the therapist will disclose their diagnosis to their parents indicates a desire for privacy and a potential fear of negative consequences from their parents knowing about their mental health struggles. This fear and preference for not involving their parents in their treatment aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as low self-esteem, guilt, and shame."
"Post: Today, my mother tried to commit suicide. Due to recent family events, it awakened childhood feelings of abandonment, inadequacy, and loneliness in my mom. She felt alone. Luckily, she was too coward to utilize her personal firearm. She chose to drink herself into an oblivion and inhale exhaust fumes. The exhaust fumes made her tired, and in her tired stupor, she thought she could sit outside and freeze to death. She had a bottle of heart pressure medication as a backup. I thank my lucky stars that she fell asleep in the grass instead. Her attempt was unsuccessful. Originally I blamed myself for having been hard on her. I have always been honest with my mother, and she has always kept a strong face. But today I learned how fragile she truly is. I take it upon myself to protect her, and support her, no matter what. She raised me and continues to raise my younger siblings. It’s time that we give back. I have been thankful that I have not suffered the loss of someone I love to suicide. I thought that I would see the signs if it were going to happen. I didn’t. I will be more aware and I will show my love for people I care about. I often think about the ones I love but don’t take the time to reach out. That changes today. I refuse to hold back my love for fear of being hurt and pushed away, for the people I love are not hearing it enough but still stay. I am grateful for the second chance with my mother. I have thought often about missing her someday when she dies. I never thought that it might come so soon. I am renewed and reborn. My goals and ambitions stronger than ever. My love for my family renewed in the wake of our war. My mother the warrior on the front lines, taking the shots from sibling to sibling and softening the blow so we all can continue the crusade. This will change. Today I choose to love."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a range of emotions, including shock, concern, gratitude, and determination. The poster discusses their mother's attempted suicide and their own feelings of guilt and responsibility. However, despite the intense subject matter, the overall tone of the post is one of hope, renewal, and a commitment to love and support their family.

I got prescribed 10mg of escitalopram (Cipralex). Anyone else on it? Any tips n tricks?

"Post: I've never talked about this to anyone I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't ""afford"" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with. I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home.

"Post: Is it stress, depression or burn out? Hey, I’m a diabetic 1 with Autism. For the past 3 years i have felt constant fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, bad memory and concentration issues. I took antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg before this during 8 months for major stress and it helped me with almost no side effects. But after i quit antidepressants Cymbalta 60 mg ,the fatigue, no motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems and concentration issues has been persistent in my life. Now for 3 years. No matter how much rest i get i feel tired. Even if excercise, eat healthy, do yoga and meditation. My blood sugar levels has been up and down lately. But even if they are controlled i feel the same. A cause could be that i have worked on a lot of projects during the past 3 years. It went as far as that i started to get suicide thoughts. I do not feel any ups or downs in my life. Things i used to like to do isles enjoyable. I rather stay at home than being social. I believe i have major depression and i have visited psychologist and psychiatrist who have advised me to take antidepressants. But the question is if I’m stressed, have major depression or simply burnt out. I certainly feel that i have a huge major depression. My OCD thought are back and i have been stuck on testing my blood sugar 10-15 times per day during the past year. Which also could bring my stress levels up. The past year has been very stressful for me work wise. But even if i get a weekend of rest i don’t feel rested. I have been to different psychiatrists and psychologist and the conclusion is either major depression or burn out. I barely have the energy to clean my apartment anymore, wash my clothes or think about my hygiene. I feel tearful occasionally on some days. I have thought about taking antidepressants again, particularly Cymbalta since it worked for me the first time. But i have been afraid of taking them. Instead my psychiatrist described me brintellix (Vortioxetine), 10 mg per day for my depression. But the question is, i’m i stressed, depressed or burnt out? Anyone have been in a similar case? Any experiences of the antidepressants brintellix (Vortioxetine) for major depression? I’m so afraid of starting to take them, but i don’t want to feel this way of every morning waking up with no motivation for anything that the day brings me."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post displays a multitude of symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as constant fatigue, lack of motivation, sleep issues, stomach problems, concentration issues, and memory problems. The poster mentions taking antidepressants in the past for major stress, which helped with minimal side effects. However, after discontinuing the medication, the symptoms have persisted for three years. The individual describes feeling tired regardless of how much rest they get, and despite engaging in healthy habits like exercise, eating well, and practicing yoga and meditation. The mention of suicidal thoughts, lack of enjoyment in previously liked activities, and preference for staying at home all suggest a significant level of emotional distress and lack of interest in life, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster also mentions OCD thoughts and excessive blood sugar testing, which could contribute to increased stress levels. The overall tone of hopelessness, feeling torn about taking medication, and fear of continuing to feel this way every morning further indicates a significant level of emotional suffering that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

Everyone I talk to, people I'd call 'friends' don't really care. They only notice me when I'm the one who talks first.

"Post: Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her? So let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first: - April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out. - June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time. - July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we'll call him Jake. - August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him. - September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything. Mid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup. And now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I can't imagine myself without her. And we're still friends, which probably isn't helping to be honest. But she's still my best friend.

"Post: Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence Hi I posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here. Im a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago. I was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. However it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. It reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better. Then 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me. I began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. I know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression. That's the conclusion I came up with anyway Thanks for reading"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and despair. The poster describes the combination of severe IBS and depression as a ""death sentence"" and expresses feelings of hopelessness, dissatisfaction with life, and a longing for a different reality. The mention of anxiety attacks, panic attacks, and feeling faint further illustrates the profound impact these conditions have on the poster's daily life. The poster also mentions being practically housebound and unable to engage in activities they enjoy due to the crippling effects of their symptoms. The overall tone of despair, hopelessness, and seeking understanding from others who can relate to their experiences aligns with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."

"Post: Need to talk and I have nobody. Hey all. Just need to talk, really struggling right now and trying to dig out of it. Not really sure what else to do. Pattern of behaviour: Wake up in the morning with immediate feelings of depression and loneliness. Acute feelings of being alone in bed, uncomfortable. Become compelled to flip through Bumble, Tinder because I feel a need to try and immediately correct the problem. I never (and I mean never) match. Have to fight urges to immediately abuse addictions like porn and weed. Sometimes do, sometimes don’t. Prepare for work, fight off feelings of sadness about ex-girlfriend and situation it puts me in. Fight the urge to blame her for the failure of the relationship even though I logically know I’m wrong or that’s not fair. She just left to pursue school and had to move on, she didn’t do anything to me. Fight feelings of rejection and feelings of inadequacy in my value to others even though there’s no reason to feel that here. Walk to work, continue to fight with anger issues re: relationships and validation. Sometimes frustration stems from lack of work success but more often than not it’s physical appearance issues and relationship issues. I get caught in a loop being mad at her and being mad at myself and my capacity to deal with being alone. Auto-pilot at work. Able to do job easily, so lack of focus is a non-issue. I spend too much time on Facebook and other social media looking for outlets to expand my social network and friends. Find it very difficult to do so without appearing over-anxious or creepy and new opportunities rarely prevent themselves. Sometimes Imarket business and contact clients/potential clients. Sometimes a boost comes from having success here, but often the lack thereof is equally esteem damaging. Go home, usually bus. Already tired. Immediately engage addictions, usually beer and weed. Start watching TV or playing games and rarely stop until bed time. I'll leave easy tasks like cleaning dishes, etc for weeks. Continual evasion of solving problems, instead opting to rely on substances to either forget or balance my feelings of sadness. Occasionally I have friends over, but many of them use substances as well or are in similar life situations so finding solace in these encounters is limited. Furthermore, they are my friends of many years and represent a kind of social stagnation. At night I’m usually in bed by 10, not because I’m out of things to do, but because I’m either drunk or bored. On weekends I’m lucky if I do anything outside of what I do immediately after work. I rarely feel compelled to do anything. If I get invited to a bar, I end up going and feeling alienated from everyone and ‘out-of-place’. Most of the time, I just feel too tired to join my friends, but I also feel a lack of motivation because I’m sure it’ll just be the same crowd—and it appears their lives keep moving while mine does not. I am behind on adulthood. I have only recently acquired a driver’s license, I just renewed my glasses prescription and only just started living on my own. I have to get my teeth taken care of and they are a source of stress and physical pain (still have wisdom teeth at 34). I have the habits of a teenager. I smoke copious amounts of weed, I drink daily and I don’t pursue my interests or goals. I know the right course of action most of the time, but I actively ignore it because the amount required to get healthy is just too much. I have spent a great majority of my life single and most of my relationships aside from a few gems have been tumultuous, emotional rollercoasters. More often than not, Despite all these things I feel undervalued in my society. I think of myself as smart, funny and confident in my skills, but I feel that the rest of the world doesn’t care and doesn’t see those as appealing. I feel like without looks and an academic education, you can only accomplish so much and that people’s standards are so high that competition for a good role in society is unlikely. I feel unable to compete when the above issues prevent me from succeeding. Motivation to do anything is lowered by the lack of acceptance in general, the feeling that I should be acceptable the way I am but am not, and my inability to seem to control that situation. It doesn’t help that on the face of it, most people will tell me that I seem like a “catch”, an incredibly high-value person with lots to offer—except that none of that seems to translate to my life, emotional attachments or stability. I'm just lost."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of struggle and emotional pain. The poster describes a pattern of behavior that includes constant feelings of depression and loneliness, as well as engaging in addictive behaviors as a way to cope. They mention feeling a lack of motivation, alienation, and a sense of being behind in life, which contributes to their feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth. There is a notable lack of enjoyment or fulfillment from activities and relationships, as well as a feeling of being undervalued by society. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-blame, and a perceived inability to control their situation aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of severe depression. The poster, who is only 13 years old, openly discusses their attempts at suicide and feelings of sadness. They express a lack of excitement about upcoming events, such as their birthday, and attribute their depression to school and experiences of bullying and exclusion. The poster also mentions using distractions like gaming, but notes that negative thoughts persist and make it difficult to engage in activities. The reluctance to pursue therapy and only confide in a limited number of people suggests a sense of isolation and possible barriers to seeking help. Overall, the emotional content of the post, along with the experiences described, align with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
"Post: Should family be more than this? I’m 24 and no kids and my family is just like everyone else’s around me; broken. My dad is sometimey and has kept few promises he has made to me. In the end it’s not him being bad that’s the problem, it’s that he says the problem is ME. Like with men I have talked to in the past, they can only say what I’M doing wrong not listening to me and claiming I am crazy. This behavior with my father led me to cutting off all contact late last year. My family, his side, otherwise see nothing wrong with his behavior. The issue is ME. I’m expecting too much from him.....like if he says he’s coming to our city (he lives 30 mins away) and I get upset when he doesn’t show and he’s done it just about every time. Or even when he claims he’s coming to get the dog he left with my uncle (left him there a year ago claiming it would only be for two weeks) he just lies constantly. I was raised around my family growing up. I didn’t see my father but I saw his side of the family, cousins, aunts and uncles. They may have lived states away but we always spent summers and holidays together. At this point my family on either side rarely see each other. We have family reunions that none of my cousins attend, all too busy now that their grown. At the end of the day I was told this; I’m an adult and my father has nothing to do with the things I’ve done in life, or nothing to do with the guys I used to talk to that led to constant rejection and overall cynical view on love (getting sperm donor at 28.) I should be grateful for times spent with him, five minutes should be the best in the world (he’s so self absorbed I’m only worth five minutes every few months) I have no right as a child to threaten him if he wont leave me alone for good. I don’t see why I have to live like this, I suffer from depression and constantly beatbox myself up over every mistake I make. I’m unhappy, I’ve been getting better since getting rid od him and focusing on the family that actually has time time for me. A family shouldn’t just be there for emergency. A family is thinking of others before themselves, loving one another enough to know them. Am I really expecting or demanding too much? Am I just mad because yet another man won’t do what I want?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does indicate some emotional distress, particularly in relation to the poster's relationship with their father and the impact it has had on their self-esteem and overall happiness. They express feelings of being let down, unheard, and unsupported by their father and other men in their life. They also mention suffering from depression and constantly criticizing themselves. These are all potential indicators of depression. However, the overall emphasis of the post is on the poster's dissatisfaction with their family dynamics and their questioning of whether their expectations are reasonable. This suggests that the underlying issue may be more related to their relationships and family dynamics rather than a primary symptom of depression."

Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of frustration, anger, and perceived unfair treatment by the poster's parents. There are mentions of favoritism towards the poster's sister, strict rules and control over the poster's behavior and possessions, judgmental behavior, and invasion of privacy.

"Post: A friend cut me off So recently a friend of mine cut me off and I’m not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story. I had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. I’m not always the most talkative type but that didn’t seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her. Eventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldn’t help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasn’t cool of me, I admit, but I just didn’t feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine. But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldn’t help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didn’t say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her. It was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I don’t try to change myself, she won’t be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didn’t make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasn’t in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didn’t text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me. I apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. I’m not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just don’t know what to think or do."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there may be some feelings of confusion, loss, and sadness due to the friend cutting them off, the overall tone of the post is more focused on recounting the events and seeking understanding rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. The poster does mention their depression and the friend's assistance in the past, but it is not the primary focus of the post and does not dominate the emotions conveyed."
"Post: What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife? Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was ""sick"" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her. The thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic ""I can't make it, we're busy"" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower. I have always been nice to her, and I'm not sure whats going on. Anyone in Reddit land have any advice? Her husband and my future husband have been best friends since high school and this is bugging both of us."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The main focus of the post is on a specific interpersonal issue the poster is experiencing with their future husband's best friend's wife.

The tone of the post is more seeking advice and understanding from others rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: Worried about my daughter I am in such a shit situation I don't know what to do. Myself and ex partner both have a child who is nearly 8 years old. We have been separated for a number of years and i see my daughter at weekends. The mother of my daughter isn't a bad person, she had a lot of bad stuff to deal with when she was younger. She basically smokes weed to shut out all the bad stuff and usually only does this when our daughter is in bed. A lot of the time she has threatened to kill herself and this has happened in front of my daughter I'm sure which is so wrong. Today when I went round she started getting angry and I heard my daughter say to her 'if you don't stop I will run in front of a car when I'm older'. This has broke my heart completely and I don't know what to do. I hope my daughter doesn't mean this and is just copying her mum, but this is only gonna get worse as she gets older. Just to be clear her mum is a good person she just has issues and goes off the rails sometimes but I know for sure she loves her so much. I was just looking for advice on what I can do to make this better. Thanks"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: Falling for someone you have no chance to be with Warning: Super long read Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with? It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take. I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ’happy’ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn’t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that’s because she’s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she’s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn’t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me. There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn’t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she’s ok. It’s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don’t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she’s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don’t know what is wrong with me, I’m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul. Next week would be the last week in training, after that we’re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep emotional turmoil and intense longing for someone the poster cannot be with. The poster describes experiencing heartbreak and depression in the past due to unrequited love and losing motivation and passion for their interests and goals. This suggests a lack of fulfillment and joy in life. The mention of friends not being supportive during their difficult times further indicates a sense of isolation and potential social withdrawal, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster also mentions feeling emotionally numb and losing the excitement they once had. They express a lack of connection with their coworkers and a reluctance to initiate social interactions, which aligns with symptoms of depression such as social isolation and low self-esteem. The poster frequently mentions the other person's clinical depression, indicating possible empathy and a desire to be a source of support, but also questioning their own worthiness and feeling tormented by their emotions. This combination of emotional distress, feelings of inadequacy, social withdrawal, and preoccupation with a seemingly unattainable love interest is consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: the beautiful things in life Light streaming through the leaves of a tree. The night sky, thousands of pinpricks in black velvet. Someone so beautiful they make you catch your breath when you look at them. Those songs that make the hairs stand on your arms. The only thing that keeps me alive is the beauty in the world. It makes time slow down just for a little, and stops the incessant flow of (mostly negative) thoughts. There's so much beauty left to see. It can be as amazing as the the clear blue waters surrounding a tropical island. It could be as mundane as a flock of birds flying in harmony over your roof. Sure, there are a lot of really shitty things that we go through, but there are those breathtaking moments you have yet to experience. Those moments where you think ""damn, it really is nice to be alive."""," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster acknowledges the beauty in the world and how it keeps them alive, but they also mention that it is the only thing that does so. This implies that they may feel a lack of purpose or fulfillment in their life, and that the beauty they see is a temporary relief from their negative thoughts. The mention of ""mostly negative"" thoughts also suggests a persistent pattern of negativity. While the post does express hope for future breathtaking moments, the overall tone is one of seeking solace and escape from their emotional distress."
Post: Keeping the Marriage Game Strong! [Momatello](http://momatello.com/marriage-game-strong/)," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not provide enough information or emotional indicators to determine if the poster suffers from depression. The content of the post seems to be related to maintaining a strong marriage, but it does not express any emotions or experiences that would suggest depression.

Post: From the moment I wake up I wish I was still asleep. Thats the hardest part about going to bed at night you know? I'd love to just sleep forever but every night I have trouble going to bed knowing I'm gonna wake up. It's the worst part of the day.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of deep sadness, hopelessness, and a desire to escape from reality through sleep. The poster describes a strong desire to stay asleep and expresses difficulty with the thought of waking up each day. This negative outlook on life, along with the emphasis on the worst part of the day being the anticipation of waking up, suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The post lacks positive emotions or a sense of fulfillment, further indicating the presence of depression."
"Post: I'm a daca recipient and I fucking hate it. I was born in Mexico and brought to the US when I was 3. This of course means I'm one of those ""nasty illegals"" everyone seems to hate. My goal has always been success. Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I wasn't going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an ""average"" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean's honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account. Because my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and couldn't even go to college in high school. Obviously they all failed. However in 2012, the year before I graduated, Obama passed daca. Because I had been here since I was a toddler, was going to finish school, and didn't have even a single misdemeanor, I was able to get a social security number, a work permit, a driver's license, open investment accounts, and received protection from deportation. Now Trump has ended it. The final decision will be made in early August, but it's most likely going to be rescinded. What am I supposed to do then? Just fucking accept losing everything? Everything I worked towards will have been for nothing. Even if daca continues, am I supposed to just keep living in fear of it ending again forever? I'm losing all my fucking hair stressing over this. I've had a cold for months that hasn't gone away, and everything hurts. I can't even talk to anyone about this. Everyone just tells me to man up and work some shitty job picking fruit in the fields. No one understands that I actually have goals in life. I refuse to accept a life where I work 60 hours a week, breaking down my body, for $30k a year with no room for advancement and living in fear every day. I've never been fond of life in the first place. The only thing that ever gave me happiness was growing my net worth, and pretty soon I won't even be able to do that. Why shouldn't I end it all at that point? That's it. I needed to rant. I'm sorry if I sound like a spoiled brat. TL:DR: I rely on daca to have an even somewhat decent life. It's being taken away. I'm losing everything."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses intense feelings of hopelessness, despair, and desire to end their life. They describe a significant loss of motivation and purpose, as their goals and aspirations are being threatened by the potential end of DACA. The mention of physical symptoms such as hair loss, prolonged cold, and general bodily pain suggests a high level of emotional distress that is affecting their overall well-being. The lack of support from others and the feeling of not being understood further exacerbate their emotional state. Ultimately, the post displays a profound sense of emotional pain and despair that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Post: My Fictional Home I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life. ‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk. A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart. The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks. ‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work. I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds. I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some. I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it. I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life. I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck. I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool. I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: Just a vent post I went grocery shopping with my mom. I manged to get on the topic of politics and I mentioned how it would be bad if people could start discriminating against someone because of their religious freedom. She told me it should be okay to do this (brought up the whole baker thing to prove her point) while saying this she told me she loved me, but didn't like how I'm gay (pansexual with some hints of genderfluid, though she doesn't know the last part) because it's a sin. I've always wanted my mom's approval, I want it so badly, I want her to turn to me and say she is proud of me..but since I was a kid she always got my hopes up, she always left me to chase after her next boyfriend. The day she left my dad I ran after her car...I don't remember how young I was. I hated her for a long time...I still kinda do.

"Post: Im a mess and I need to rant. Every so often, I'll find a glimmer of hope and try my hardest to change my life. I'll start exercising and eating healthy, and pushing myself to talk to people, and I'll actually feel pretty good for a few days. Then I just stop. I'll wake up one day and and have absolutely no desire to be healthy anymore and slip right back into feeling like shit and hating myself because I can't commit to the simplest of things. This is probably the fourth time it's happened in the past year. I made some really bad choices today regarding food, which made me feel so much worse because in my eyes, my worth as a human being is directly tied to the shape of my body. Nobody could ever convince me that it's not. This past bought of motivation, I tried to convince myself that I was going to exercise and eat right for the sake of my health, but in the back of my mind, I knew the only real reason was because I wanted to lose weight. And now here I am, completely abandoned diet and exercise and right back into the throws of depression. All I want to do anymore is lay in bed and try to fall asleep. I don't have a job (or the desire to have one) and I lost most of my friends because I never talked to them. I live with my mom who I thought I could talk to about anything, but I feel like I can't tell her about how bad it's gotten. It doesn't help that she tells me everyday that I need to get a job. I know she is right, but it makes me feel like an even bigger piece of garbage because I've never held down a job for more than 4 months. If I got a job right now, I'd probably have a breakdown and quit the first week. I went through cosmetology school and put myself into debt just to wind up hating the field and trying to lie to myself that I didn't. I thought it was all about doing hair, but it turns out it's all about trying to get people to buy some shitty hair product. I know my outlook on the world is fucked up, but I don't know how to change myself. It's like all these negative thoughts are engraved in the back of my skull. I just feel like I'm stuck and any move I make is the wrong one.

The poster describes feeling like a mess and expresses a pattern of starting to improve their life, only to quickly lose motivation and slip back into feeling like shit and hating themselves. The mention of making bad choices regarding food and feeling their worth as a human being is tied to the shape of their body suggests deep self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression.

"Post: Struggled with depression and anxiety for 3 years and made it through Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences with depression and anxiety in the hope it might give someone else a reason to keep going. I’m new to reddit, so I hope this is okay! I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the past three years and it’s honestly been the most difficult thing I’ve ever dealt with. Mental illness is silently crippling. I’ve spent more nights than I can remember wracked with sobs, feeling incredibly alone, and fantasizing about suicide. I’ve spent more days than I can remember feeling hollow, being apathetic, and not caring about what happened to me. Depression is a fucking bitch, and even now, when I actually feel happy and loved and excited for my future, I’m not naive enough to think that I’ll never have to struggle with my mental health again. But I think I have learned how to best cope with it. Medication didn’t work for me, and while I do believe that professional therapy can be invaluable to people struggling with mental illness, it didn’t make a big difference in my case. But I learned to focus on the present, to rely on loved ones I’m lucky enough to have, and to forgive myself. Take it one small step at a time. So what if you couldn’t leave your room today? That shit’s fucking hard! You got up and you got out of bed, that’s the first step. Learn to love yourself even through the despair and self-loathing. There is no one path to overcoming depression, and sometimes it’s not exactly the cure-all you envisioned but rather learning to live with it. But I promise you all that one day, it will be better. You will be happy again. And until then, I’m happy to listen to you if you ever need anyone to talk to or have any questions."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep and personal struggle with severe depression and anxiety that has lasted for three years. The poster describes experiencing intense emotional pain, feelings of loneliness, and suicidal thoughts. These are all indicators of extreme emotional distress commonly associated with severe depression. The post also acknowledges the difficulty of finding effective treatment, as medication and therapy did not make a significant difference for the poster. The mention of learning to cope with the symptoms, relying on loved ones, and forgiving oneself suggests an ongoing battle with depression but also hints at resilience and a willingness to support others going through similar struggles.

"Post: Sick of rejection Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that. After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of 'test the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text). So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it. The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down.

"Post: Looking for an opinion So I have been angry for awhile now, and I feel like my anger is unjustified. A few weeks, I told one of my close friends that I had feelings for her, and I also told her I wanted some space to get over these feelings. This is because I couldn't be with her. She has a significant other. Soon after, she wouldn't talk to me at all, and she avoided me. All of her friends told me that I shouldn't have done that because it was a bad thing to do. I just wanted to tell her that I wanted some space from her, so I could no longer have feelings for her. Since then, all of her friends, have treated me with aggression and insults. I get dismissed every time I'm around her and all of her friends. This has launched me into another Depressive episode. I was yelled at by other people and ostracized. I was thinking that what I did wasn't so bad, but maybe I'm wrong. I feel like a bad person. I know this probably ridiculous, but I've also feel like killing myself because being ostracized and dismissed is one of my fears.

Post: I try so hard to care for other people. Why does nobody care about me? I spent hours trying to cheer up my friend a couple days ago about her family issues. I messaged her today about my depression and she ignored me. Why? Why am I not good enough? Why do people say they care when they don't? People only like me for what I can give them.

"Post: Life is so fucking bullshit You think your family cares about you and would do anything to help you, but that's a fucking lie. Both my parents said they went through a ""deep depression"" that was as bad or worse than mine when they were my age, yet they show 0 interest or care in helping me. I have a sore throat? Oh Jesus go to the walk-in clinic immediately! I say I'm extremely depressed and feel no happiness anymore? Oh yeah we can totally fix that by having a talk every 3 months with you when you have a mental breakdown. I feel like they want me to die since they don't give a flying fuck about my mental state, and when we talk about it they just say shit like I have to be more positive. I've started working out again last week, something I couldn't do for almost a year due to being injured, and I feel nothing from it. I used to love working out so much but now it feels like something that betrayed me, as I'm always gonna be doomed to be skinny because I'm too depressed to have an appetite to eat enough. Fuck sakes I hate my life that's slowly being wasted everyday.

"Post: Does anyone else get very irritable whenever you're hungry? The biggest problem in my life is that I get extremely irritable when I'm hungry. I'll find myself fantasizing about getting in argument or getting mad about something and then kinda snap out of it and realize I'm actually just hungry. Then I get something to eat and I can feel some of the stress melting away, taking deep breaths and shit. This happens every day. This makes me pretty cranky while I'm making something to eat in the kitchen. If anyone tries to talk to me I just want nothing to do with them until I get some food in me.

"Post: Coursemate [19F] wants me [18F] to find potential housemates, has high demands but i’m doing all the work :/ So at uni it’s time for students to be looking for a house to rent for the next academic year. Usually people live with friends they’ve made and such or just go on facebook and join groups. The place we’re interested in is a 6 bedroom house, I personally wouldn’t mind an all female house or with 2 boys and 4 girls idc. But my coursemate said she’d prefer 3 girls and 3 boys. Well so far we have 4 confirmed girls (me, coursemate and a girl that SHE found), i’m currently getting enquiries from girls and a few guys but if i’m doing this on a first come first served basis, it’s looking to be an all girls house. She made me look for the house, call the agent, book an appointment, put an ad on facebook.... She said that she has some anxieties doing some of this which i guess i can understand bc sometimes i have bouts of social anxiety that i can’t help so i am a little sympathetic... But she’s being very demanding, i couldn’t look at any houses over the weekend bc i was with my boyfriends meeting his parents and his family so i couldn’t drop all that and go on my laptop doing all of this !! If i tell her that it’s looking to be an all female house with maybe one guy, i’m a little scared to know her reaction... But then again, she’s made me do all this work and yet would have to audacity to complain ?! I feel like she has a certain demographic in her head of what kind of boys she’d like in the house (she’s a lesbian so it’s not like that) ... idk ... I’m not sure what to do or say... shall i accept the girls that are actually willing to pay and be proactive or decline their offers JUST because my mate “wants boys”🙄? **TLDR** friend and i need to look for a house with other ppl for next year, she’s making me do ALL the work, is demanding and wants some boys to live with us. Only girls have been seriously enquiring... how do i tell mate ?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no.

"Post: I’ve been depressed all my life and I’m just tired I️’m finding it harder and harder everyday. I’m almost 23 years old and I️ can’t even function properly. I️ feel like I️ have the mental capacity of a child sometimes because I️ don’t know how to do anything. My entire life I️ lived in fear of my parents and now that I’m out I️ just can’t function at all. I️ had to quit my job because I️ couldn’t handle being at work in my emotional state. I️ can’t handle people being vaguely negative towards me. I feel awful because now it’s just my fiancé working, but he says that it’s okay that I️ need time.. I can’t help but feel he resents me for it. I don’t even know how we’re going to pay for our wedding. I️ don’t know anything about feminine hygiene, or how to brush/style my hair. It’s just matted in knots and up in a bun, or if it looks decent enough I’ll put it in a ponytail. I️ don’t know how to keep friends because I️ was constantly grounded for everything. I️ spent most of my life alone in my room, when I️ was grounded I️ wasn’t allowed to eat dinner with the family. I️ have 2 step sisters, one half sister, and 3 half brothers. All from 3 different marriages not including my parents’ since I’m their only child. And I’m not close with any of them. I️ don’t even know all of their ages. I️ didn’t have mother figure in my life because my stepmoms were just either physically abusive or emotionally. My dad was a drunk, and just controlled every aspect of my life yelling at me if I️ didn’t want to do something or had different opinions than him “you think you’re in control of your life but you’re not. You belong to me” or make weird sexual remarks in front of his friend when I️ would have a friend over “oh you two girls are probably going to kiss and rollover on top of each other” thankfully not in front of her. But sadly our friendship didn’t really last very long. Then he convinced me to get really drunk when I️ went to go visit from college and his friend tried taking advantage of me when I️ was trying to sleep it off in my room. I️ want to get a better job than the one I️ had previously but my upkeep is awful and I️ probably wouldn’t get hired.. And I️ know I️ have to better myself but it’s just so hard I️ just don’t know where to start. I️ have no money. No friends. I️ practically have no family because I️ never want to go back. I️ dropped out of school because I️ couldn’t afford it anymore because my dad stole the money I️ saved up. But even if he didn’t I️ probably still would’ve dropped out because I️ couldn’t pick a major, I️ kept changing it, and I️ feel like a loser because I️ was supposed to graduate this year. I️ used to be really good at math and writing and now I️ can’t even remember simple math or how to use proper grammar. I️ find myself not knowing how to spell words or using the wrong ones and it just makes me feel so stupid. I️ hate it. I️ was diagnosed with BPD and I️ can’t even afford to treat it. My car stopped working, and I️ don’t even know how to use a bus. I️ hate my life. I️ hate everything. I’m just so tired of it all. I️ already went to a mental facility for a month and I️ still can’t function. I️ can’t bring myself to end it all because I️ love my fiancé more than anything. He’s been my one true friend since high school, even if we only spoke at school, he’s always been there for me. I️ can’t leave him. I️ don’t know what to do. I don’t have clear thinking. I️ hate that I’m so black and white, I’m just trying to be gray. I’m so sorry this is so long, this is my first post, it’ll probably get removed because I️ don’t even know how to use reddit but whatever venting this out helps a bit even if no one reads it."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: My friends acting dumb and I don’t know what to do? So I have a “friend”. Let’s call this “friend” B. I’ve known B for most of my school life (we didn’t talk from K to 5th grade bc different classes and moving away). In 6th grade she was the only friend I had in academic classes and we both formed a squad (spoiler: it didn’t last). Essentially we were very close and have a lot of inside jokes. Starting last April, B started ignoring me after I told her I wanted to do an assignment sheet alone. She took it the wrong way and we ended up fighting the entire break. We made up quickly and life was normal again. Another long ass fight happened over the summer for unknown reason. Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later. She’s probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. She’s also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (let’s call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out. I don’t know how to deal with the friendship since I’m scared to deal with B. Any advice? TLDR: My friend is toxic and obsessed with me. I don’t know how to break it off without hurting her feelings?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of distress and frustration with the behavior of the friend described as ""B"".

"Post: Went through tough times, friends weren't there, but I still want them in my life. I have 2 best friends from high school since we were young. Long story short, we were the best of friends, had a great friendship and were really good to each other. We are all 19 now, and I went through a bad time the end of last year, my brother was shot in the shoulder as a accident at work, and had alot of issues with my childhood come up. The only difference with my friends and I is that I grew up in a completely different way then they did , I was raised in foster care, that was tough, I grew up poor and had many bad things happen during that time, on the other hand they had very loving parents and a great home. They dont seem to understand some of those things and find it hard to understand why I am the way I am sometimes I need my space and need to be by myself, Being in a foster care that had terrible people in it, I never had celebrated birthdays since a young age, like 3 and when i was 15 was when I found out that they are special days , and so when birthdays do happen I may come across as blunt? Or dont make a massive deal out of it for them sometimes, and they take all of that as I am being blunt and they seem to move away from me and dont make plans with me, same as when my brother was shot, I was a mess, initially they were there for me but eventually they drifted off. But as always we came back together and were just like old times, I know and they know Im a person who likes to deal with things on my own, but I just feel like a burden in their perfect world. I feel like their parents dont like me because of my family history and the way I grew up, I just dont want to always feel like a burden on my friends."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: How can I get out of an almost constant state of dissociation? A majority of the time I’m just in a state of dissociation. It’s difficult for me to describe, but it’s like I’m just not mentally there. It’s like a constant state of autopilot. I’m there but my mind isn’t. My mind is always so foggy and difficult to navigate through. Most of the time, I’m just mentally empty. I used to never be like this but I can’t remember what life was even like before this. It’s been like this since I was 14. I’m 19 now and I want to get out of it badly but I don’t know how I can."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

"Post: In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I? I’ve been friends with her for 3 years. She’s a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her. She apparently sensed it and recently asked me what’s wrong between us, telling I should tell her if there’s something. Some of the things I’m thinking of telling her are: - she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I don’t know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.) - she’s a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldn’t wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how he’s like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes I’m broke and I feel sort of belittled. - she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip I could list several things, but I’m not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I don’t want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them? Also, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and she’s basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, I’ve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months. I enjoy hanging out with her (A), and we text each other all the time, but I’m not sure how she (A) feels about this. Thanks for taking your time to read this, I appreciate it.

Reasoning: The post discusses a situation with the poster's best friend and seeks advice on how to approach it. While there is some mention of feeling weird, hurt, and belittled by the friend's actions, the overall tone does not convey a deep sense of emotional pain or hopelessness that is commonly associated with depression. The primary focus of the post is seeking advice and exploring different ways to communicate with the friend, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Post: Status in family tree Using a throwaway for anonymity :) I recently found out that I was 'related' to someone, but after asking for more details, I'm confused as to whether it is true or not. This person's mother is cousins with the woman married to my grandfather's brother. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I honestly don't know where else, any help would be appreciated!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster is seeking assistance and clarification regarding their family tree, showing a curiosity and desire for information rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress.

"Post: Stop and think for a moment It's like stumbling around in the darkness. You can't see, you can only feel. Blinded by the pain of reality. You beg it to stop, as the throbbing in your heart grows stronger. But it's not gonna stop, no matter how hard you beg. Your so called 'friends' abandon You, because your depression talk has gotten too dark. But what's the worst part? That you can't control it? That you can't stop it? Maybe it's the fact that just maybe... just maybe you don't want It to stop. You cling onto your pain, because after all..it's familiar. It's been with you for a while. You stand upon the dark edge, upon the highest edge you could find. You feel the wind blow in your face. You freeze. All the good moments, All the good people. It all comes in floods of part nostalgy and part regret. What took you to this edge? What made you so desperate, To take such drastic action? While the pain is temporary, This thing you're about to do - It's permanent. Stop and think for a moment. Because no matter how long a storm lasts, You still enjoy the rain... You still love the sound of thunder."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and desperation. The poster describes feeling blinded by the pain of reality and begging for it to stop, but feeling unable to control or stop it. The mention of ""friends"" abandoning them because their depression talk has gotten too dark indicates a lack of support and understanding from others. The post also suggests a desire to cling onto the pain and even contemplate self-harm or suicide, as evidenced by standing on the ""dark edge"" and reflecting on the good moments and people in their life before potentially taking drastic action. These thoughts and feelings are indicative of severe depression and a significant level of emotional distress."

"Post: Why have I never had a Long term friendship? I have never had a friend longer than a handful of years. I don’t understand why , I have no friends from my childhood or tween years. Now entering college I am scared I am going to be in this situation for the rest of my life. Why can’t I keep friends for a long period of time?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits feelings of loneliness, confusion, and fear regarding the poster's inability to maintain long-term friendships. While these emotions may be distressing, they do not reach the level of very severe depression.

Therefore, the assigned label of ""No"" indicates that the poster does not suffer from depression based on the emotions expressed in the post."
"Post: My parents’ living room is not large enough... My sister and I are visiting our parents this weekend - celebrating a family holiday. Overall it’s been a lot of fun, but this evening, there is a particular tv show that my sister and mom wanted to watch. Sister begged to get the “comfortable chair”. Mom and dad are sitting in their respective chairs. My choices are the folding chair or the floor. Also, sister’s devices are taking up the only proximate outlet, and I only have 10% on my phone battery. I am exhausted - it’s been a fun weekend but there was a lot of planning and I haven’t had much sleep. I’d really prefer to go upstairs to the bedrooms. My mom really wants me to sit with them... but I’m just too exhausted. I don’t want to spend an hour and a half on a folding chair OR on the floor. I don’t want to watch this TV show - they can watch it but I’m just not interested. I especially don’t want to spend an hour and a half in an uncomfortable chair, watching a TV show I don’t care about, with a dead phone battery. So I’m in the kitchen right now, with my phone plugged into an outlet. Debating how angry my family will get if I go upstairs and lay down. Debating if I even have enough energy to stay awake for another hour and a half. This is a small thing compared to most of the posts on this board. But dear heaven, I’m tired..."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses feelings of exhaustion and a desire to rest, it is primarily in the context of a specific situation (visiting parents and participating in a family holiday). The levels of distress and hopelessness described in the post are relatively mild in comparison to the severity commonly associated with very severe depression. The main focus is on physical fatigue and discomfort rather than deep emotional pain or numbness. Additionally, the poster acknowledges that this is a small issue compared to others, indicating a perspective of situational exhaustion rather than a pervasive and severe emotional state."
"Post: Don't know what to do. I have an older sibling who I don't see anymore. Cut a long story short, when she was younger she didn't like the way she was parented and basically reported my parents. She was taken off them and placed into a care setting. She is now a lot older and I have seen her a couple of years ago but we have lost contact all of a sudden. I never use to be allowed to speak to her because apparently she was trouble. But I miss my sister because she is still my sister. She used to always say I could go see her when I'm 16 and my parents can't tell me what to do. What do I do in this situation?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of confusion and uncertainty about the situation with the poster's older sibling. There is a mention of missing the sibling and wanting to maintain contact with them. While there may be some underlying emotions such as sadness or longing, the post does not exhibit the same level of emotional distress or hopelessness commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more focused on seeking advice and guidance in a specific situation rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain."
Post: Does anyone talk to themselves? I do all the time. I’m trying to stop.," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster talks to themselves frequently and expresses a desire to stop this behavior. Although the emotions in this post are not explicitly mentioned, talking to oneself excessively can be a sign of depression. This behavior may be a coping mechanism or a way to alleviate feelings of loneliness or distress. The poster's desire to change this behavior suggests that they are aware that it may not be healthy or beneficial for their mental well-being. While this post does not provide extensive emotional context, the mention of talking to oneself can be a subtle indication of underlying emotional struggles associated with depression."
"Post: Judgemental Family! I have such a judgemental family, they all speak about each other and criticise everything you do. I’m fed up with being controlled and having judgements made about me. I can’t leave as I just can’t afford a place of my own. They won’t listen when I try and rationalise. Even the smallest mistake is taken out of contexts! I really feel like my mental health is suffering.... I’m aware that not much advice can be given but I needed to vent. Anyone out there feel the same?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of frustration, being controlled, and having judgments made about oneself by a judgmental family. The poster mentions feeling like their mental health is suffering and expresses a need to vent. These emotions align with common experiences of individuals with depression, who often feel overwhelmed by negative emotions and unable to escape from difficult or toxic relationships. The mention of not being able to afford a place of their own adds to the sense of being trapped and lacking control, which can contribute to feelings of depression."
"Post: I'm tired of forcing myself to do things. Maybe it's me being lazy. Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADHD. I don't know. All I know is that I hate not being able to enjoy almost *anything*. I just feel so numb and dull. I dropped almost all of my friendships with people who are not in my workplace. Haven't had the motivation to talk to anyone. It just feels like a chore to me. Socializing is torturous and I get bored very quick. I can't seem to focus on any conversation. I hate forcing myself to do the most simple things, like: taking a shower, putting on makeup, cooking, cleaning, even playing videogames. I'm a huge WoW nerd, so I should be excited for the new patch and game. But, I'm not. I got amped up when I saw the trailer, but now, I rather not play it. I rather not play anything. Just recently, I forced myself to play Bioshock again. It's been years since I visited Rapture. I *love* Rapture. But why is it so boring to play? I used to have so much fun... How do you get out of this funk? I don't want to feel like this and it is ruining my life. Not to mention, my SO and I haven't been doing well because of it. I just feel...nothing. I need help, but I don't want a therapist or any new diet plans. None of that copypaste bullshit. What *actually* works? Also, I forgot to mention that I smoke weed daily. I heard that it can make depression worse and I've been using it for almost two years now. Is this something I should only do at night? I originally used it for sleep."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses a deep sense of exhaustion, numbness, and lack of enjoyment in activities that were once enjoyable. The poster describes dropping friendships and having a lack of motivation to socialize, which can be indicative of depressive symptoms such as social withdrawal. They also mention difficulty in focusing and a general feeling of boredom and apathy towards things that were once exciting. The mention of their relationship being affected by their emotional state further indicates the impact it is having on their daily life and functioning. The post also reflects a sense of hopelessness and desperation in finding solutions, mentioning a dislike for traditional coping methods like therapy or diet plans. The mention of daily marijuana use and questioning its impact on their depression also suggests the presence of self-medicating behavior. Overall, the combination of emotional distress, lack of enjoyment, social withdrawal, and impact on daily functioning align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Should I have kids? Here’s why I’m asking: My mother has an undiagnosed mental illness, of that I am certain. My best guess is either bipolar or borderline personality disorder. Growing up with her was difficult and she never got the help she needed. My brother and I suffered greatly as a result. The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isn’t real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful. In those moments I wish that she wasn’t my mom and that I wasn’t her son, or that I could permanently swap heads with someone else. I think about all this as my fiancé and I talk about having kids. Both of us are ready and we want to be parents so very badly, though I haven’t brought up my fears to her. I worry often about passing on that illness to our children. My fiancé doesn’t deserve that, she shouldn’t have to face those hard challenges. I love her so much and the thought of doing that to her kills me inside. I feel so much shame around wanting to be a parent because of this that I wonder if I should be one at all, or rather, a biological one. It’s something I’ve never really thought about before now and I don’t know what to do. Please help"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes growing up with a mother who had an undiagnosed mental illness and the impact it had on their own mental well-being. The mention of certain tendencies, such as obsessing and feeling abandonment that isn't real, suggests the presence of significant emotional distress and potentially the presence of a mental illness. The poster expresses feelings of disgust and shame and wishes to be someone else, indicating a low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness. The fear of passing on the illness to their own children and the concern for their fiancé's well-being suggests a deep sense of responsibility, guilt, and self-doubt. The shame and uncertainty surrounding the desire to be a parent highlight the internal turmoil and conflicted emotions the poster is experiencing."
"Post: I haven't spoken to my siblings in years I'm 19, and I haven't spoken to my sister and brother in literal years. They live overseas and haven't visited since I was 10. It's not bad emotions or anything, not at all. I just don't call or text and neither do they. I didn't grow up with them, so my other siblings (who live here and I talk to regularly) know them better. I feel left out. I don't want them to think I don't care about them. I feel so bad all the time about it. I know I can just reach out, but I feel awkward doing it. I've tried FB messenger but they don't use it a lot, so now I'm trying to get their WhatsApp info. How should I reach out again? I know this is a weird situation."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of sadness and longing for connection with the poster's siblings who they have not spoken to in years. They mention feeling left out and express a desire to reconnect with their siblings, but also feeling awkward about reaching out. While there is some emotional distress, it does not reach the level of very severe depression. The focus of the post is more on seeking advice and guidance on how to reconnect, rather than expressing a deep sense of hopelessness or despair."
"Post: Does anyone care? I have 1 friend but I haven’t physically seen them in 7 years but we FaceTime and talk every single day until recently. No big deal I’m pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we don’t talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here’s the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you don’t even get a text asking if you’re okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I’m okay. I mean I don’t expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they’re okay. I mean, how can you say you’re friends with someone but not even say anything when they’re threatening to kill the selves. It’s weird, you’ll be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they’ll make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol. Worthy enough for a number on Snapchat but not worthy enough to live in their eyes Sorry for the rant, just wondering if anyone is expierencing this or idk."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness, despair, and feelings of insignificance. The poster expresses disappointment and hurt at not receiving care or concern from their friends, especially when they openly express thoughts of self-harm and depression. The mention of feeling unworthy and questioning their worth in the eyes of others further indicates low self-esteem and emotional distress. The overall tone of the post suggests a significant level of emotional pain and isolation that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: FIL &amp; BIL literally make themselves at home when they visit I like my home to look nice when guests come over. Sometimes I’ll have a lightly scented candle on in the bathroom or hallway or I’ll turn on a lamp to light up my entryway. The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea. Whenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while he’s here. I recently noticed that he’ll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. He’ll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when he’s only been here for like 20 minutes. A few years ago, when he lived with us for a minute he rearranged my guest bedroom AND would rearrange everything around in my kitchen! I’m like wtf, I like my keurig right where it is! Thank you! Another wtf, we have a sectional that sits about 7-8 people comfortably when FIL/Bro IL come over they insist on spreading out and lay across the whole damn thing. Do they offer me a seat when I come over? No. It’s only until my bf scoots over to make room for me so I can squeeze in to sit somewhere at the end of the couch. Oh and bro in law? He always makes sure we know he eats gluten free. FYI he is NOT allergic to gluten and insists that “If the package doesn’t say Gluten Free it’s not gluten free.” Everyone knows not to start that argument with him, there’s no point. Even if I mention that if my friend who has celiac disease can eat something it’s gluten free. He just shakes his head like idk what I’m talking about. I don’t really say anything cause for 1 FIL is old and for 2 they are both only over a couple times a month. What’s the point anyway when I forget all about it the following day? They’re here for the SuperBowl and I’m aggressively writing this as I’m squished into the corner of my own couch. Would you guys even say anything? What would you say or do? And how much longer is the super bowl?!"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not provide clear indications of depression. While the poster expresses frustration and annoyance with their FIL and BIL's behavior, there is no strong indication of emotional distress or hopelessness. The focus of the post is primarily on the frustration caused by the guests' actions and seeking advice on how to handle the situation. There is no mention of symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as feelings of sadness, lack of interest or pleasure, or thoughts of hopelessness. Overall, the tone of the post is more about a specific situation rather than reflecting deeper emotional issues commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Sister dislikes me. So me and my sister barely speak and barely see each other, but today just made it clear how much she dislikes me. She spoke to everyone but me, I could even see her giving her fiancé looks every time I spoke- I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety so when I tried to speak to my family in the room she would speak over me about something else to that same person I was speaking to. You see, I had an abortion just months before she became pregnant and ever since then she has been off with me. She gives me looks every time I go near her son or even when I attempt to smile at her. I just don't even know anymore. Her son is 2 just to give you a reference of how long it's been. We was fine during my process of going through the abortion but now she just doesn't care to try."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: the post indicates that the poster is likely suffering from depression. The poster describes feeling disliked and excluded by their sister, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation. The mention of chronic depression and anxiety suggests that the poster already struggles with their mental health. The poster also mentions having had an abortion, which can be a traumatic experience that may further contribute to their depressive symptoms. The overall tone of despair, confusion, and a lack of understanding about their sister's behavior indicates significant emotional distress, which is consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: I felt happy the other day and now I'm worse off I went on a date the other night, my first one in a very, very long time. It went surprisingly well and the guy was really sweet and understanding. The whole date I felt the overwhelming sense of loneliness I struggle with disappear. My mind was clear and I was able to be quick witted, funny, and upbeat. I was happy for the first time in ages. Now that it's over, I feel worse off. I forgot what it feels like to not be crushed by depression and all the shitty things that come with it. The depression has seeped right back in and it hurts more now. I should be grateful I was able to escape it for a moment, but fuck no. I almost wish I didn't have to be reminded of what normal felt like."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post reveals a rollercoaster of emotions, starting with a brief moment of happiness during a successful date. However, the poster quickly transitions to expressing a deep sense of loneliness, the overwhelming presence of depression, and a feeling of being worse off after experiencing a brief respite. They describe a clear contrast between the temporary relief from depression and the subsequent intensification of their depressive symptoms. The strong language of feeling crushed by depression and the desire to not be reminded of what normalcy feels like suggests a significant level of emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Nothing. I just don't want to do anything. Nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore. The stuff I study in school is really cool, but when I get home I just want to lay down and do nothing. Smoking weed makes it easier but I know I'm just pushing my feelings away. I'm just... Tired. And I feel like a bitch because of it. I go to school, work on some homework, go to work, procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time, rinse, repeat. I wish I could stop working and just focus on school, cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as I can dedicate the time to it. But after working I just wanna do nothing. And if I work less hours I just get stressed about paying rent. I don't know if I hate myself or this economy more, but I just wish I could go far away sometimes. Just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing. Listen to a waterfall crash in the forest, or just look up at a sky that isn't polluted to hell with light. I've been so good lately; Been through this long enough I know why I'm like this. It's February. And February always sucks."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of apathy, lack of motivation, and exhaustion. The poster expresses a desire to do nothing and finds temporary relief in smoking weed, although they are aware that it is only a temporary solution. They mention feeling like a burden and experiencing stress about work and paying rent. The longing to escape suggests a desire to isolate oneself from the world. The mention of February always sucking may indicate a pattern of seasonal affective disorder or a general worsening of mood during this time of year. The overall tone of hopelessness, lack of motivation, self-criticism, and desire to escape aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: How do i stop negative thoughts? I try to be positive. But honestly the last 2 years has been hard i feel my thoughts are getting worse and worse. I think i am worthless, weak, pathetic and more. And i dont know what to do these thoughts are eating away at me. I can have a good day and then start thinking these thoughts and lose all self confidence. The sad thing is that my friends tell me im worth less also and i try to change as a person to please them. I know i should not hang out with them but then i wont have any friends at all and i will be even more lonely."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post strongly indicates the presence of negative thoughts, low self-esteem, and a significant impact on the person's emotional well-being. The poster describes a pattern of worsening thoughts, feeling worthless, weak, and pathetic, and an inability to stop these negative thoughts from consuming them. The mention of losing self-confidence and attempting to change as a person to please others suggests a lack of self-acceptance and a desire for validation from external sources. The statement of feeling more lonely if they were to cut ties with these friends also implies a potential lack of support or healthy relationships in their life. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Does anybody else go for late night walks hoping you'll walk into someone who's also feeling the same ways? I don't know why it's never even had any romantic thoughts but it's always been a female, i always get a sense i will walk into someone going through the same things and somehow we'd know and just walk together without even talking but feel okay. Maybe its just a way to cope with feeling alone, but I haven't seen daylight in a week so whether its loneliness or a sense of something to come I'll continue. See you out there"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post expresses a desire for connection and understanding from someone who may be experiencing similar emotions. The poster describes going on late-night walks in the hope of encountering someone who feels the same way, emphasizing a sense of loneliness and a need for companionship. The mention of not having any romantic thoughts and specifically hoping to encounter a female suggests a longing for understanding and support rather than a focus on forming a romantic relationship. The use of the phrase ""feeling alone"" and the mention of not seeing daylight in a week indicate a deep sense of emotional isolation and despair, which are often associated with symptoms of depression. Overall, the post displays a strong emotional distress and a desire for connection that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
Post: Family troubles So me and my husbands parents and sister had a falling out two years ago about 3 months ago was the first time we saw each other at a Xmas gathering and while the falling out was happening my husbands sister fell pregnant with their first child and she is due in two months but they aren’t referring to me as Aunty but the will say uncle to my husband and I’m finding this a bit hurtful as technically I am the child’s Aunty and did nothing wrong to his family oh and I refer to his sister as Aunty to my kids and they are my kids god mother before the falling out happened. What should I do?," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on a specific issue within the poster's family and seeks advice on how to handle the situation. While there may be a hint of hurt and confusion regarding not being referred to as ""Aunty,"" the tone of the post does not exhibit the strong emotional indicators commonly associated with very severe depression. It does not express overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of enjoyment in life."
"Post: A depressing poem. My lips betray, They belie the scream piercing my mind, “What’s wrong?”, “Nothing, I’m fine.”"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of deep emotional pain and a struggle to express that pain to others. The reference to a ""depressing poem"" suggests a preoccupation with negative emotions. The use of phrases like ""betray"" and ""piercing my mind"" indicates the intensity and torment of the poster's emotions. The contradiction between the poster's response of ""Nothing, I'm fine"" and the evident distress in the poem indicates a reluctance or inability to openly express their true emotional state. These elements align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

"Post: Am i simply lazy or is there something more? If this doesn't fit this sub please delete. I'll be short, not the best writer. I am university student, 25, about to get bachelors degree in programming. Never had a job , leeching from mom. After four years of study i realized that at best i am average, at worst i am below that. Before going to psychiatrist(spelling?), decided to ""look around"" and see if there is basis for it or not. Now,apart from feeling useless and generally thinking that i have no future. I simply don't have any motivation. I know i need to do things, i want to do them, but simply cant gather up motivation or focus to do them. I keep switching between other things, starting to watch videos , only to switch to another one, reading articles, browsing reddit until it's too late to do anything. Then promising i'll do it tomorrow. Worst thing is that i don't really care if i fail. Anyone experienced something similar? TL,DR: Can't gather motivation to do anything, i need to do it, want to do it, but simply can't start doing it. Keep switching between doing other things instead. Anyone has any similar experience?"," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","yes.

The poster describes difficulty gathering the motivation to do things they know they need and want to do, often getting distracted and procrastinating instead.

"Post: My step brother came out to me while drinking and I'm not sure if he remembers A few days ago we were pretty drunk, he more drunk than I, and he told me he sometimes finds men more attractive than women. He said he had never told anyone else that. I was very supportive and told him I was proud of him, but I'm not sure if he remembers having this conversation. He made sure to say multiple times that this is something he would want to talk about sober, but I'm worried that might have just been the alcohol talking. The topic hasn't come up since. I'm not sure if I should bring it up. I don't want to embarrass him or force him to come back out if he doesn't remember it, but I also am worried that he may remember it and be to embarrassed to bring it up himself. I just want him to know that I still love and accept him without making him feel awkward or pressured in any way.

The tone of the post is supportive, caring, and focused on the well-being of the step brother, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Post: Clingy friend So I have a friend who lives pretty far from me. Let me preface this by saying that he has expressed a romantic interest in me, but I am not interested in men, and have told him so. He helped me through a difficult time in my life, and I have thanked him many times for it. I have tried to do the same for him on multiple occasions, but it seems like the more attention I give him, the more he wants. I do not feel that we need to have hour long phone discussions and 26 text messages on a daily basis - I don’t talk to ANYONE that much. I started ignoring a text or two here and there, hoping he would catch on. He did, apparently, and we just went about 3 weeks with no contact. Had he sent me a normal text today, I would have answered. Instead, he sent a passive-aggressive “Ever since you’re feeling better, you never bother to call me.” This is simply NOT true. I have called him many times when he said he needed to talk, even though I hate talking on the phone. I just simply can’t take this level of neediness. I’m not sure how to explain to him that constant contact drives me nuts and I need space. Every time I try to explain this to him, he seems to feel that it was designed as a personal attack against him. Any thoughts on this? I’m not going to text him back until I’ve had some time to think about the right thing to say."," Question: The answer to the question ""Does the poster suffers from depression?"" is ","no. Reasoning: The post does not suggest that the poster suffers from depression. Although the post describes a difficult and frustrating situation with a clingy friend, there is no mention of emotional pain, lack of enjoyment, hopelessness, or any other prominent symptoms commonly associated with depression. The focus of the post is on seeking advice and sharing experiences related to dealing with a needy friend, rather than expressing deep emotional distress. The tone of the post remains practical and problem-solving oriented."
