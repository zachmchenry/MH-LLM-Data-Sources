"A vent more than advice post my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me"" half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his."" and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row. not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me. tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks.",0,"No. 

The poster expresses frustration and sadness about feeling like they are not a priority to their friend and feeling like they have been put on the backburner. These emotions are understandable in the context of the situation described but do not necessarily indicate depression. There are no other indicators of depression mentioned in the post.","[3, 3, 2]","[2, 3, 2]","[3, 3, 2]","[2, 3, 2]"
"I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids? I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future.",0,"No. 

The poster does not exhibit any signs of depression in their post. 

Firstly, they appear to be seeking advice and asking questions about their own personal preferences rather than expressing hopelessness or sadness. They specifically state that they are not asking to be convinced either way and are simply looking for guidance. 

Additionally, although they appear to be unsure about their future desires, they do not express any negative feelings towards their present circumstance nor do they appear to be experiencing any of the common symptoms of depression such as loss of interest, low mood or hopelessness. 

Overall, the post appears to be a rational and objective exploration of the poster's feelings towards having children, without any of the signs of depression.","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 3, 2]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 2]"
"Anyone want to talk with me tonight? Just lonely, need to get out of my head.",1,"Yes.

Reasoning:

The post shows signs of depression based on the following:
- The poster expresses loneliness which can be a symptom of depression
- The poster mentions a need to ""get out of their head"" which can suggest overthinking and negative thought patterns commonly associated with depression
- The poster is reaching out for human connection which can be a sign of depression-induced isolation.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 2, 3]"
"isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real? There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why. Anyone else feel like this ? Sorry for terrible punctuation.",1,"Yes. 

The poster expresses their struggles with depression and how challenging it is for them to conform to societal norms every day. They also mention feeling like they are falling off the wagon, which could be a reference to a relapse in their mental health. The mention of their ""own personal hell"" also indicates that they are dealing with significant emotional distress. Additionally, the intensity of their emotional response to seeing others treat suicidal thoughts and coping mechanisms as fun memes suggests that this is a deeply personal and emotional issue for them. All of these factors together suggest that the poster is indeed dealing with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"Not allowed to feel bad? I feel like I'm not allowed to feel bad. I'm an unimportant piece of shit and there are so many other people that need help and all the other people are a lot more important than me. I'm not considered as a person, I'm just something to use to pull yourself up. It's like I'm stuck in a swamp and all the people step on me and push me deeper down just to get out themselves. I guess I don't deserve to feel good. Noone will care if I will kill myself. They'll just use another person.",1,"Yes. 

The language used in the post suggests a sense of hopelessness and worthlessness, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster expresses a feeling of not being allowed to feel bad, indicating a repressed expression of emotions, which is also a common symptom of depression. The statement, ""I guess I don't deserve to feel good"" shows a lack of self-worth and an inability to feel pleasure, which are also signs of depression. Finally, the mention of suicide suggests the presence of suicidal ideation, which is a serious symptom of depression that should not be ignored.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"No one is gonna read this Nobody likes me and every time I interact on reddit i tend to be a laughstock and receive a bunch of downvotes, because I'm a worthless piece of shit that shouldn't even be breathing. Just wish to be happy but that's impossible, my only purpose is to choke on a fat dick and die because i'm a faggot",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

1. The use of negative self-talk (""worthless piece of shit"") and self-deprecating language (""choke on a fat dick"") suggests low self-esteem and a negative self-image, which are common symptoms of depression. 

2. The hopelessness expressed through the statement, ""Just wish to be happy but that's impossible,"" is also indicative of depression. A common symptom of depression is feeling a sense of hopelessness or that things will never improve. 

3. The fact that the poster perceives themselves as a ""laughstock"" and receives downvotes on Reddit is likely reinforcing their negative self-image and contributing to feelings of worthlessness and rejection. 

Overall, the negative self-talk, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness suggest that the poster is experiencing symptoms that are commonly associated with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"
When will this inescapable wait ever end? I feel as though this is never ending and nothing good will ever come out of it. I’m underserving. I have both a long-term mental illness and a long-term physical illness. One’s willpower is limited. I struggle everyday both physically and mentally/emotionally. It’s been years. My physical illness affects my mental illness and vice versa but they are offend uncontrollable! I suffer from chronic low self-esteem due to my illnesses. I don’t know I just feel hopeless and helpless. My willpower feels drained. I don’t know how much longer I can keep holding on. It’s not holding on that’s difficult. What’s difficult is holding on when there may be no meaning to it. What if I hold on with all my will and I find out there’s nothing to it. My whole life would’ve just been meaningless suffering. I keep trying but sometimes it’s really hard and I’m scared and lonely.,1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, the poster expresses hopelessness and helplessness, which are common symptoms of depression. They feel like nothing good will ever come out of their situation and have chronic low self-esteem due to their illnesses. 

Secondly, the poster mentions struggling every day both physically and mentally/emotionally, and having illnesses that are often uncontrollable. This could suggest a lack of motivation and enjoyment in daily activities, another common symptom of depression. 

Finally, the poster expresses fear, loneliness, and feeling drained of willpower. These are all emotions commonly associated with depression. 

Overall, the combination of hopelessness, low self-esteem, lack of motivation and enjoyment, and negative emotions point to signs of depression in the poster.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 2]","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 2, 2]"

I just quit my job because it was causing more panic attacks ...so now I’m without a job and still depressed! Basically life sucks for me!!!!",1,"Yes.

The poster explicitly states that they are feeling emotionally unstable, depressed, and that their life is ""a complete crap"". Additionally, they mention quitting their job due to panic attacks which is a symptom commonly associated with anxiety and depression. Therefore, it can be inferred that the poster is exhibiting some signs of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"does it ever feel like your friends arent really there? I genuinely care for and love my friends so I regularly ask them how they're doing on messenger since they all live so far away. I know my friends struggle with depression so I make it a point to contact them and let them know I'm here for them. But most times I am left on ""read"" or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They don't really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I'm doing. I hope I don't sound selfish in any way, but it just feels weird to care so much for people who don't seem to care that much for you. It hurts sometimes that I also struggle with depression but have no one to talk to..",1,"Yes. 

The poster mentions that they know their friends struggle with depression and that they also struggle with it themselves. They also express feelings of hurt and loneliness, indicating that they may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Additionally, the fact that they feel like their friends don't care for them may also contribute to these feelings.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond. My emotions have become so numb that I can't feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There's nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I don't know what else to say. It's the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I don't even look forward to coming home from work because it's not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It's all the same dullness. I'd probably work 12-14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it wouldn't bother me at all, I'm not missing out on anything. Too bad they don't because they don't want to pay overtime for me of course.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, they mention feeling emotionally numb and unable to enjoy anything they used to like doing. This is a common symptom of depression known as anhedonia. 

Additionally, they mention not looking forward to coming home and feeling like everything is dull and the same. This could also be a symptom of depression known as feelings of hopelessness or apathy.

Lastly, they mention working long hours and not minding it because they don't feel like they're missing out on anything. This could be a sign of depression affecting their motivation and enjoyment of leisure activities.

Overall, the combination of feeling numb, not enjoying things, feeling everything is dull, and lacking motivation to do anything outside of work are all indicators of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 2]","[3, 2, 2]"

Reasoning:
The post expresses a negative outlook on life, particularly in regards to enjoying good experiences. This lack of enjoyment and feeling that even good times are tainted is a common symptom of depression.

"My Life = Depressed Cycle HELL I have been depressed since my early teens. 18 now. In last year of high school but my grades are horrible, Im MISERABLE at my job but cant quit due to the pay, I completely lack a social life and girlfriend, and have so little motovation I feel like I will flunk out of college if I go. I was going to go to talk to my psychiatrist that does medication management for ADD when I went to see her the other day. I literally couldnt suck up the pride to tell her I was depressed and need a psychologist referal. She even asked how my moods were and I said they were just fine. I feel weird just meeting a random psychologist and dont know how to find a good one. Being a guy I have just sucked it up for the last 5 year and I feel weak for needing help, and even with me telling myself I need help I keep thinking every psychologist listing i see isnt good enough and keep pushing it off like I have for a LONG time. My life is a MISERABLE cycle of depression that I cant seem to get out of. I NEED help but I literally dont know how I can get myself to suck up the pride and go to a psychologist.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression.

Reasoning:
1. The poster states that they have been depressed since their early teens and are currently 18. This suggests a long-term experience of depression.
2. The poster describes feeling miserable at their job, lacking a social life and girlfriend, and having little motivation, indicating a loss of interest in activities and low mood.
3. The poster also expresses difficulty in seeking help and feelings of weakness for needing it, which is common in individuals experiencing depression.
4. The poster's reluctance to tell their psychiatrist about their depression and need for a psychologist referral further suggests a lack of motivation and difficulty in taking action to address their mental health.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]"
"I lost a friend I just graduated high school and all throughout high school I have struggled with depression and anxiety. At my school, there was this really cute girl who I had a crush on. She was in two of my classes and I got know her pretty well. Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she wasn't into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she's really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school. It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she didn't really seem interested in being my friend. Now it's summer and I've tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together. I want to tell her how I feel and that I wish I could be her friend still but I'm worried it will just create a bad situation. I really don't know what to do.",1,"Yes. 

The poster explicitly states that they have struggled with depression and anxiety throughout high school. This suggests that they have previously experienced symptoms of depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that they would feel better when spending time with their friend and that they are now feeling unhappy and upset due to the loss of that friendship. These negative emotions could be indicative of depressive symptoms. Overall, the tone of the post reads as one of sadness and emotional pain, further supporting the presence of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 2]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 2]"

Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

1. The poster has been stuck in an episode since their birthday, which implies a prolonged period of feeling down or experiencing negative emotions.

4. They haven't left the house in a week and struggle with the motivation to do things they had planned to do.

5. They express a deep yearning for physical comfort and affection, but feel it fades into an empty void, which suggests an ongoing feeling of emptiness or hopelessness.

6. The poster notes the loss of their faith and how alone they feel in dealing with their struggles, which may indicate a lack of support and a sense of isolation.

Feeling nostalgic? Does anyone else obsess over a point of time in their life when they felt like they were truly happy? For me the last time in my life when I felt like I was truly happy was 2013 and 2014 (mostly the summers) Ever since then life has changed so much. My depression got worse than ever. I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what? I keep telling myself this is just a stage and things will get good again but it just seems to get worse. Nostalgia can be a great feeling but it’s killing me now knowing how good life once was.,1,"Yes.

The poster explicitly mentions their depression getting worse since the time when they were truly happy in 2013-2014. They also express feelings of sadness and hopelessness about their current situation and future prospects (""Does it ever get better again or what?...it just seems to get worse""). These are common symptoms of depression, indicating that the poster may be suffering from this condition.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally: * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person. It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me? I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself, and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness, meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with. I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone.",1,"Yes. The poster openly discusses their diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts, as well as their current struggles with loneliness and feelings of meaninglessness. They express a desire to understand their own thoughts and emotions in order to address their depression, and detail various attempts to escape their painful memories and distance themselves from others. They also mention feeling depressed while walking the streets in search of job opportunities, and reflect on the importance of human intimacy as a safety net during difficult times.

"Can’t fix anything in my life I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self. Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that.

Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy. The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me.",1,"Yes, the poster shows several signs of depression. 

Firstly, the sense of hopelessness and helplessness is evident in the language that they use. They state that they are ""fundamentally broken"", ""a fucking loser"", and ""not even a real person"". These negative self-perceptions are common in depression, and they also indicate a lack of self-esteem and self-worth.

Secondly, the poster talks about being unable to handle the pain that comes with self-improvement, and how this leads to feelings of anger and bitterness towards themselves and others. This may be a sign of anhedonia, which is a symptom of depression where a person has difficulty experiencing pleasure or interest in normally enjoyable activities.

Thirdly, the poster mentions feeling jealous of others for having something they do not, and fantasizes about violent and destructive behavior. These are also common symptoms of depression, which can lead to feelings of isolation, resentment towards others, and even suicidal ideation.

Overall, the language used in the post and the negative self-perceptions and emotions expressed suggest that the poster may be experiencing depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 2]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 2]"
“I wonder how the world would be if they didn’t have me” I heard this lyric and it sticks with me....fuck,1,"Yes.

The post expresses a negative self-evaluation and a sense of worthlessness. The phrase ""it sticks with me"" indicates that the poster may have been ruminating on this thought for some time, which is a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the use of profanity at the end suggests a strong emotional reaction, which is also typical of depression. Therefore, the overall tone of the post is indicative of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"

"My best friend of 11 years got engaged and I wasn’t invited. So, I just don’t know how to feel it’s not her fault that I wasn’t invited or told about it. Her fiancé didn’t bother to call us (my other best friend and I). He had his family, her family, his best friends, and their amway business partners(that’s a whole other hot mess). But anyway, I was working and got a phone call from an old friend and asked me how excited i was that my best friend was getting engaged. I replied “I had no idea.” She just said, “Oh..” I’m so hurt. But I don’t really think her man cares. He doesn’t like me and our other friend for reasons unknown to me. Now I’m asking myself will I even be invited to the wedding? Because I doubt I’ll be a bridesmaid. Idk I feel crazy for being hurt but. I’ve known this girl since I was 16 and I’ve know her man for 6 years. Why wouldn’t you even let us know that you were going to do this?? A text would’ve sufficed.. *sigh* really trying not to dwell on this but it really makes me hurt inside.",0,"No. 

The poster expresses hurt, disappointment, and confusion over not being invited to their best friend's engagement and not being informed about it. However, there are no other significant signs of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or persistent sadness or loss of interest in activities they used to enjoy. The poster also expresses a desire to move on from the situation and not dwell on it.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]"
"Is youth wasted a result of mental illness or is the mental illness a result of wasted youth? As hard as this hits me and as much as it demotivates me, I personally think it's the latter... At least it looks like it in my case",1,"Yes.

The post shows a sense of hopelessness and lack of motivation, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster is also reflecting on their own personal experience, which suggests they may be struggling with their own mental health. Additionally, the language used, such as ""hits me"" and ""demotivates me,"" suggests a lack of emotional control and possibly low self-esteem - both of which can also be symptoms of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"

Reasoning:
The use of phrases like ""I hate myself"" and ""nothing but contempt for myself"" indicate a strong negative self-image and self-criticism, which are common symptoms of depression. The statement ""My feelings just don't want to feel anymore"" also suggests a lack of motivation or interest in activities, which is another key symptom of depression. Therefore, based on the language used and the expressed emotions, the poster is showing signs of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"
"I dont have friends. So i was talking over phone to my female best friend. I was sharing my problem with her i had recently. Now we supposed to hung up. But unfortunately phone didn't cut.

I dont know how to react when i am going to meet her next time.",1,"Yes. 

The post clearly states that the poster is ""depressed af"" after discovering that their best friend was jealous of them and even thankful for their recent failure. This revelation has ""broken"" their soul and shattered their trust in the last person they thought they could confide in. These feelings of betrayal, sadness, and disillusionment align with symptoms of depression. Therefore, the poster's emotional response suggests that they are experiencing depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"
"How to stop being friend with a person that i'm envious of ?? Hi... I'm a university student who befriend with a person who also study in the same university as me as well as enrolling in the same bachelor degree. When i befriend with this person, i just feel a lot of inconveniences and jealousy in my life. Honestly, i often feel envy of his high scores, actually sometimes i even help him to do an assignment (like sending him a copy of my assignment) which annoyingly also makes him get a higher score than me. He is a good guy, but i just really don't want to befriend with him anymore because of this kind of inconveniences and jealousy. I know, maybe some of you see me as the ""Toxic Friend"" or the ""Bad Guy"" here, but, i don't really care. The question is... How to stop being friend with this person in a gradual way ?? If i stop helping him in doing assignments, will it help me to break this friendship ??",0,"No. 

The post does not show any signs of depression. The poster expresses feelings of inconvenience and jealousy towards their friend, but these emotions do not necessarily indicate depression. Additionally, the poster does not mention any symptoms of depression, such as feeling sad or hopeless, loss of interest in activities, or changes in appetite or sleep patterns.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]"
"I don't care about anything. I have been really trying to figure how to stop feeling this way and I've seen a pattern which is just do something. Be create. Do something you like. Shit like that. I don't think people understand that I don't care about anything. I don't care. I don't like anything. I tolerate it. I don't like my favorite shows. I don't my old hobbies. I don't like the people I used to like. I don't like anything. I don't care about anything. I feel empty. Like all the things that made me who I am is gone. I don't care. How is ""doing I like"" helpful when I don't like anything? When I don't about anything I am doing? That is the reason I stopped doing first place. How is doing those things again going help me? This is like the biggest suggestion I have seen and I think pretty unhelpful. I can't just make myself care. I've tried. I wish I could care about those things again but I can't so suggesting to do those things, as if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. ""Oh your depressed? Just do what you like."" No. I don't want to. I don't want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and can't. To want to care and you just can't. I've tried medication and therapy. I've tried giving so many fucks and I can't. I can't even fake it anymore. I wish I could. How do I care again? Do I just wait? I don't think much longer.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Reasoning: 

1. The poster begins by stating, ""I don't care about anything."" This is a common symptom of depression - feeling apathetic towards things that were once enjoyable or important.

2. The poster goes on to describe feeling empty and as if ""all the things that made me who I am is gone."" This is also a common feeling associated with depression - feeling as if there is a lack of purpose or meaning in life.

3. The poster describes having tried medication and therapy, which suggests that they have sought out professional help for their mental health. This is a common treatment approach for depression.

4. The poster expresses a desire to care about things again but feels unable to do so, which is consistent with the experience of many people with depression who feel stuck in a state of emotional numbness or detachment. 

Overall, the language used in the post suggests that the poster is experiencing a significant amount of emotional distress and a lack of motivation or engagement with life - all of which are common symptoms of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"
"How do you get a job after over a year of unemployment? F early 20s. I never finished college, came home, and I've been so depressed that I haven't done anything since I left school in 2016. I'm a really hard worker and I've always been liked by my bosses, but I don't feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs I've had I kind of - just - abandoned. I would get to a point where I couldn't handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if I wanted to come back during a break from school and I would never call back. Now I'm in this weird limbo that I don't know how to get out of because I basically don't have any credentials or references and there's a massive gap in my resume that I can't explain.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, the poster mentions feeling depressed and having social anxiety, which are common symptoms of depression. 

Secondly, the poster admits to not doing anything since leaving school in 2016, which could indicate a lack of motivation and interest in activities, another symptom of depression. 

Thirdly, the poster mentions having abandoned previous part-time jobs due to their mental health struggles, which could indicate difficulty functioning in a work environment, another common difficulty associated with depression. 

Overall, the language used in the post suggests a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, further supporting the idea that the poster is struggling with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"I probably ruined everything Tonight I ruined almost a year of work. My girlfriend of 12 years and I had a really rough 10 months, and I have been working really hard to build up our relationship. However, tonight my depression and an existential crisis got the best of me, and I made a stupid decision. I tried to steal a bunch of things from Walmart, but I got caught. Her sister is the manager, and was the one who caught me. I told my girlfriend and she didn’t say anything. I’m worried that I’m going to lose her. If I lose her, I’ll have nothing. I may as well not exist, because she is my only source of happiness. I know I don’t deserve her, but I need her desperately.",1,"Yes. 

The poster expresses feelings of depression multiple times throughout the post. They mention their ""depression and an existential crisis,"" and also state that they ""may as well not exist,"" indicating a lack of self-worth and hopelessness commonly seen in depression. The fact that losing their girlfriend would mean they have ""nothing"" and would need her ""desperately"" further points to a dependency on their relationship for happiness, which can also be a symptom of depression.","[3, 2, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 1, 3]","[2, 1, 3]"
"I don’t want to lose friendship of 10 years but I think it’s going that way Hi guys, I don’t usually do this but I literally feel like I have nowhere else to vent. Ok. I have been friends with this person for 10 years since we were teenagers. We both clicked over time through going to the same school and I really liked her personality. We ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and I let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to. After graduation she’s spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much, though we have met up when she’s been back. So the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but it’s been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didn’t want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didn’t reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if she’s busy and have stressed to her that I don’t want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and it’s basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding. The thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I can’t think of anything. I have questioned whether I’m getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that she’s suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldn’t be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other. But if for some mysterious reason she’s cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can I do? I basically sent her a message saying I wouldn’t try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that. I feel like I may never hear from her again and it really hurts. But what can I do? If something isn’t there anymore then it’s just not there. - A 20 something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit",0,"No. The post does not show any signs of depression.

"""I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either."" Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace. I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful. The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said ""alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?"" I'd say ""no thanks, I'm good"". With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole. I should stop before I become some combination of ""old man yells at cloud"" and ""whiny emo stereotype"". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others wasn't there. But it is, so here I am.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Reasoning: 

1. The poster expresses a sense of hopelessness and lack of desire to live or be alive, which are common symptoms of depression. 

2. They also mention feeling a weight emanating from their core, which can be interpreted as a feeling of sadness or heaviness associated with depression. 

3. Additionally, the poster mentions not wanting to complain or whine to others, which is a common avoidance behavior among depressed individuals. 

4. Lastly, the poster expresses a lack of interest in career advancement, romance, and having children, which can also be indicative of depression and a diminished capacity for joy and pleasure.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I’m sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship. A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more. After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn’t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now. 3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again. I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now.

Here are some of the reasons why: 

1. They mention feeling extremely depressed after the breakup with their ex, to the point where they couldn't take care of themselves. 

2. They talk about still feeling depressed and feeling like they're in a rough place, even though it's been over a year since the breakup. 

3. They mention struggling with their appearance and feeling like they're doing worse than their ex in that regard, which could be a sign of low self-esteem. 

4. They talk about feeling lost and useless to the world, which is a common symptom of depression. 

5. They mention that they've distanced themselves from friends, which could be a sign of social withdrawal.

I've never felt more alone in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move. I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore. I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship. I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I don't need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.,1,"Yes. The poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, they express feeling ""more alone or lost or confused"" than ever before, which is a common symptom of depression. Additionally, they mention feeling worthless and convinced that their friends only pretend to like them, which is indicative of low self-esteem and negative self-talk that can be a symptom of depression. They also mention not feeling important and seeking validation from others, which can be a sign of depression as well. Overall, the poster's feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, and confusion indicate that they may be struggling with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"

The poster expresses feeling depressed whenever they are at home, which indicates that they may be struggling with depression. Additionally, the fact that they are constantly feeling the desire to leave social situations and go home, despite being around friends, suggests that they may be experiencing symptoms such as social withdrawal or lack of enjoyment in activities they once enjoyed.

1. The poster mentions having suicidal thoughts, which is a common symptom of depression. 
2. They also mention having depression and anxiety, which can be co-occurring disorders. 
3. The poster expresses concern about their boyfriend worrying and not wanting to burden him, which can be a symptom of depression in terms of feeling like a burden on others. 
4. They also mention needing extra support, which suggests they may be struggling with managing their mental health on their own.

The language in the post displays a deep sense of nihilism and apathy towards life. The poster is explicitly stating that they do not care about living or dying and that nothing in life has any meaning. This lack of interest in life and its pursuits is often a symptom of depression. Additionally, the use of profanity and the bolded ""JACK FUCKING SHIT"" suggests a strong feeling of hopelessness and frustration.

The emotion expressed in the post is ""super low"" which indicates a state of sadness or low mood. This feeling persisted long enough for the poster to seek a friend to talk to. This could be an indication of depression as it is a common symptom of the condition. Seeking social interaction can be a way of coping with feelings of isolation and loneliness which often accompany depression.

NY. around so many people i feel like a lost soul. &amp; it don’t seem like anyone understands me. so i still feel... different... i started typing about my childhood but that’s a story in itself so i’ll keep it to my more recent years. suicide.. it’s growing on me everyday. just for the simple fact that i think myself into this mood where i think everyone’s life would be easier without me around. not to toot my own horn but i’m pretty popular, so i know people would be affected by it for a couple days but who really CARES enough to actually help my mind get to a better place? i’ve seen it happen plenty of times in this place i call home. i have had the same friends for 10+ years, very authentic friends but i feel we’re outgrowing each other.. youngest kid to a very loving hard working single mother of 3 but i always felt like the odd child.. &amp; currently in a 2 year relationship with a girl anyone would want.. (i recently started blaming her for cheating from thinking too much) but yet, i don’t feel not even half complete. i shut down &amp; don’t talk to those who mean most to me to the point where they think i have a problem with them... &amp; i don’t know how to control it. i was never able to talk to a counselor or mentor cause i never felt real love from them. but sometimes i think i just need a open ear i can vent to without everyone else knowing about it. that seems to never happen though. not to sound like a hippy, loll but i live my life off of vibes, if you know what i mean.. &amp; as of late i don’t even know what a vibe is. i just want to be left alone to think. recently deleted all social media accounts, just isolating myself from my surroundings.. i feel like everything is coming to an end soon. idk. i just need that push. i don’t want to be a waste of life when it’s all said &amp; done.",1,"Yes.

"Lost and Alone Hi, I’m 19 and I’m at my low point. Up until last year my life was pretty good, but now everything has fallen apart and I have no clue where to start picking up the pieces...

"I want a cat so much due to depression and loneliness... I once had a cat I had got for my 16th birthday over 10 years ago before she died at a bit of a young age just almost a year ago. She helped me so much whenever I had suicidal thoughts; when I would get them and tell myself how much I should die, I would think of her, and then ask myself ""Who would take care of her? She would be so devastated if her own master was gone. I could never do that to her."" But ever since her death, I think I've been more depressed and lonely without her. I've been so much more angry and isolated, I think. I want a furry companion so, so much, but I don't think it will happen anytime soon, no matter how urgent or how much I rather need one, and that makes me even more depressed. There's been so much going on, so it's not a good time to look for a kitten; however, the thing is, I don't know how much longer I have to wait, and I don't know how much longer I \*can\* wait, because my family moved, and the house we live in is being renovated, so I don't even have a room yet. My wild guess is that it could take maybe a year for everything to settle, but I cannot wait that long at all before getting a cat. I'm torn. Should I just get a cat for the sake of my health, or should I endure the wait a little longer so things can settle down a bit more?",1,"Yes, the poster shows clear signs of depression. They express feelings of loneliness, isolation, anger, and a strong desire for a companion animal to help alleviate their depression.

"A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive? A long time friend of mine (let’s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but I’m not sure if it’s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now we’re not speaking. Also, we’re 14 and just started high school. 1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just ‘being honest’. 2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn’t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn’t want to ditch her if she hadn’t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn’t bother me (it didn’t, I was upset because she didn’t care about me) and that she wouldn’t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy ‘we’ll sor-ry’. 3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off. I thought this was smart. I figured they’d either realize we weren’t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse. Eventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came. Now, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood. I don’t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, “You realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.” I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I’m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, “Hey, I heard you were followed...” or ANYTHING. Just straight up “it’s your fault I have no sympathy.” Like, Hey, nice to see you too. Either way, we’re not talking anymore. I’ve tried to bring it up but it’s always, “I was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? You’re being silly...” No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, I’m scared to be alone.

At the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin?",0,"No.

I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do. I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one. My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth. I honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up. I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure.

1. Negative self-talk: The poster uses harsh, self-deprecating language to describe themselves, calling themselves an ""ugly piece of shit,"" ""fucking pathetic,"" and ""missing out."" This is a common symptom of depression, where individuals have a negative self-image and low self-esteem.

2. Lack of enjoyment: The poster expresses feeling left out and invisible in social situations, and struggling to find joy in their life. They describe everything as being ""shit"" and express no interest in high school or potential future plans. This lack of enjoyment in activities they once found exciting is a common symptom of depression.

3. Hopelessness: The poster is fearful of the future and sees little hope for positive change. They describe a potential boring job and a life of routine, feeling that they are already beyond the point of no return. This sense of hopelessness is a common symptom of depression, where individuals feel that their current situation is unlikely to improve.

I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I don't want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry. Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I'm crashing all of a sudden. I don't know how I'm going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I'm fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I haven't seen her in awhile and I don't have money to go back to her. My psych appointment isn't until late January, after my medical procedure. I just want to be happy and have some motivation for fucks sake.",1,"Yes. 

The post contains several indications of depression, including feelings of hopelessness, lack of motivation, and disinterest in previously enjoyed activities. The poster also expresses a desire to sleep and not participate in everyday life, which are common symptoms of depression. The irritability and heightened emotional response to minor events, such as spilling coffee, are also potential signs of depression. The fact that the poster was on antidepressants previously and is experiencing a relapse into depression after going off medication further supports the diagnosis.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"

The poster's statements of feeling like they are just floating through life, lack motivation, feel stupid and useless, and feel lost and alone are all common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the difficulty in making sense of their emotions and the sensation of a mess in their brain are also indicative of depression.

"I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all. I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems. I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample: - I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) - There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day. I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious. The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together. - I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so."" - I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. - Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events. I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities. Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband. After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump. I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know. I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human. I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure. I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off. I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine. I'm trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare.",1,"Yes.

Firstly, the poster mentions that they are afraid of being a disappointment and afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human, which shows a lack of self-esteem and self-worth. Additionally, they question their decision to quit and feel like a failure, indicating a sense of hopelessness and worthlessness. The fact that they considered jumping off a mountain and have to fend off depression symptoms also suggests a possibility of depression. These emotional expressions are consistent with symptoms of depression. Therefore, the poster shows signs of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 2, 2]","[3, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 2]"
"I am scared Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase. Anyway, a bit of back story: Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc. Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie. So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible. Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do? I've added an image for reference: https://imgur.com/8fZq5JO Edit: I never blocked him, I deleted my account because fuck Facebook.",0,"No.

Secondly this was because of that but I because shy and anxious all the time thinking about what people thought of me. So didn't make many friends in school. Then during school my attention gravitated towards video games and my grades became shit. Therefore felt like university wasn't an option for me.

2. The poster expresses extreme devastation and embarrassment, suggesting they have negative thoughts about themselves and their abilities.
3. The mention of ""throwing away tens of thousands of dollars"" and feeling the need to pay back their parents' investment indicates a sense of guilt and responsibility, which are common feelings in depression.

"Can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure? It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of ""well if I can't make myself better through such simple actions I must be even more of a failure than I realised"". I appreciate the science behind it, releasing endorphins yada yada, but if I can't bring myself to drink water or get out of bed how am I supposed to go for a jog? If I'm so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better? Where do I find the energy to go for a hike when being awake for three hours makes my body physically ache? I get it, it's helpful for a lot of people but telling me to go get my yoga pants on and be at one with nature will not cure a thing and by repeating that useless mantra you're making me worse. Rant over, I'm going back to bed. Edit: a few people telling me if I exercise I will lose weight and feel better about myself. I only need to try it apparently. On the advice of my doctor, I have tried it, even walking. I do walk, every day, no matter how I feel. I also don't need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed (because I'm not overweight). Just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra as if it's the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that has nothing to do with how often I move, flex or jump. My point is that it's not working.",1,"Yes.

1. The poster expresses frustration and a feeling of failure in not being able to engage in exercise or hiking as a cure for their mental illness.
2. They also mention struggling to even get out of bed or stay awake for more than three hours, which could indicate fatigue and lack of motivation often associated with depression.
3. Finally, they explicitly state that they have a ""very real mental illness"" which suggests that they may have been diagnosed with depression or another mood disorder.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 1, 3]","[3, 1, 3]","[2, 1, 3]"

I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I'll admit this one was getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could've prevented it. But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal ass girl. But I love her. I love being around her. And she probably doesn't even give a shit about me because she has a boyfriend. We hung out at a park and had a great time, we always do when we talk...

I wish you'd just tell me to fuck off, but you keep saying yes. All while you straight up don't give a shit about me. Hope is the worst part. I'm still clinging to my failing studies, new random ass coins and this *fucking* girl. I can't even concentrate on the other two because I think of her all the time.

"GF stopped taking antidepressants So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive. It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go. I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it’ll help the “chemicals leave her body.” I don’t know what to do. I want to support her decision but her getting off her meds is clearly affecting her negatively and she’s even sadder and less motivated to do anything now. It’s currently impossible for us to live together and we visit each other 1-2 times a year when school is out. We’re both in uni. I myself stopped taking antidepressants cold turkey as well (that was about 5 years ago) and I’m still depressed but not to the point where I can’t go out and do what I’m supposed to like she is experiencing right now.

"Advice for making it through school In my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and I lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function.

I failed everything and took a year off. My family was so disappointed and treated me so differently for the year that I was out.

The poster's description of losing motivation, panicking and crying when faced with schoolwork, feeling scared, and giving up after their cat died all point to symptoms of depression. These symptoms were severe enough to cause the poster to fail all their classes and take a year off from school. Their family's disappointment and change in treatment towards them during this time could also contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth, which are common in depression. Additionally, the poster mentions that they are currently feeling low despite doing well the previous semester and are struggling to regain faith in themselves.

Furthermore, the poster mentions suppressing their emotions and feeling guilty for expressing their feelings to a friend who has it worse, which could also be signs of depression. Overall, the intensity and frequency of negative emotions expressed in the post suggest that the poster is struggling with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 2]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 2]"
"hot and cold friend I do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time. Some of them have developed into stronger friendships (we bond on more than just gaming). I became close with one guy in particular and I'd say he's become one of my best friends. We met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation, we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and IM. Initially, we texted all the time but I've been noticing very recently, his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent. I get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but I feel like things have changed. I had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate; always asking about my day, initiating conversations, and just being a kind friend in general. If it's been a couple of hours and i haven't replied, he'd message me to check up. I admit it was a bit intense at first but I had gotten used to it and reciprocated. But now that he's kind of dropped off, I feel like I am becoming overbearing and that's the last thing I want to be. I feel like I'm putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days. I've brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just aren't what they used to be. On top of that, I am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me...I don't nearly game as much as he does so when I do come online, we usually play games together. Sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more, we game with each other. We don't really play in groups much because he's a bit of an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable in large group settings. The other day, I was invited to play with a friend we made online. Prior to this, my friend and I had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early. But me not wanting to play with our new friend alone, i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me...but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird. Eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so I was happy by the time I called it a night and found that all of them were bonding. These incidents have happened a handful of times in the past month and it's left me slightly annoyed and very confused.",0,"No. 

The poster expresses emotions of confusion, annoyance, and concern about the change in their friendship, but there are no clear signs of depression.

1. Lack of motivation and energy: The poster mentions that the thought of showering and getting ready seems like too much work. They also spend most of their time in bed.

2. Feelings of worthlessness: The poster refers to themselves as a ""nasty bitch"" and ""unkempt girl"" multiple times, suggesting they feel negatively about themselves and their appearance.

3. Difficulty performing daily activities: The poster mentions only being able to brush their teeth and engage in hobbies on a good day, indicating a difficulty with completing basic daily activities like showering and getting ready.

4. Poor self-care: The poster acknowledges that they don't like feeling dirty or smelling bad, but still struggle with taking care of their personal hygiene.

My cat just got hit by a car I can't even think about it too much. My family is a little sad but are kinda telling me to get over it. I've been in such a terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks and this just ruined everything. When older pets die by natural causes I don't cry as much as because I know we gave them the best life and they lived very long but my suki was only 2 years old she was so fat and adorable and I can't believe she is gone just because of a bad driver. She always came to me when I was upset she'd lay on top of me and snuggle. I wish I had more time with her. now I have almost nothing that makes me smile,1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Step-by-step reasoning: 

1. The poster mentions being in a ""terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks."" This suggests that they have been experiencing symptoms of depression for some time now. 
2. The death of their cat has ""ruined everything,"" which can be a common feeling for someone experiencing depression. 
3. The poster mentions not being able to think about the situation too much and feeling like they have ""almost nothing that makes [them] smile."" This can be a sign of low mood, lack of pleasure or interest, and apathy - all of which are common symptoms of depression. 
4. Additionally, the lack of support from their family can further exacerbate feelings of sadness and isolation, which are other common symptoms of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"
"I don't trust my in-laws with my daughter. I just don't. It's hard to explain. Maybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I'm old-fashioned. Bottom line is: Their lifestyles, comments to me, comments about my kids, bad tempers, alcohol intake, drug use, and pasts instill in me no confidence that they can be responsible caretakers of my daughter. I hear so many stories of child abuse -- sexual abuse, especially. From family members, most often. I'm just not comfortable taking that risk. I'm not afraid to offend my in-laws. But other family members say I'm being unreasonable. What's a healthy perspective here? Does every parent have these fears? Am I being unreasonable? Should I trust my instincts?",0,"No.

Reasoning: The post does not express any of the common symptoms of depression such as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or loss of interest in activities. The main emotion expressed in the post is anxiety and concern for the safety of the poster's daughter. While it is important to acknowledge and address anxiety, it does not necessarily indicate depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"Desperately want to WANT TO get better Attempted suicide May 1st, wasted a week of my life in “voluntary” inpatient, was put on the one drug that has ever helped me (olanzapine, an antipsychotic) which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again. Was able to drag myself through some intensive outpatient group therapy for a while and then quit that too. The only good thing I have left in my life is my fiancé. I know it’s not healthy to live for another person but I’m not exactly in a position to nitpick. At this point all I can do for them is try to be as reliable as possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they don’t have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle. But I want more? I want to be able to grow with them and be an active part of a life they enjoy? I want to repay them for all the things they do in vain to try to make me happy? But all of my options in recovery range from extremely corny (literally all talk therapy, individual and group, dbt to cbt to emdr) to actually detrimental to my health (reactions to and side effects from medications). What the fuck do I do so I don’t lose the last good thing I have?",1,"Yes, the poster shows multiple signs of depression. 

Firstly, the poster mentions attempting suicide on May 1st, which is a clear indication of significant distress and hopelessness. 

Secondly, the poster describes feeling unable to engage in therapy options and feeling stuck in their current situation. This sense of hopelessness and lack of motivation is a common symptom of depression. 

Thirdly, the poster mentions struggling to find ways to repay their fiancé for their support and care, which suggests feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem. 

Overall, the presence of suicidal ideation, lack of motivation, and feelings of worthlessness all point to a significant depressive episode.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"

"I just don't know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I'm sure I have been happy some time along the way but I can't remember. I think most of the ""good"" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer. I've dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I've been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point. I am just completely exhausted at this point and don't know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doesn't help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I'm interested in. They can't understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task. They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I'm pretty sure the main reason that I'm not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just wouldn't be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle. As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just don't know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now. All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away.

I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do.

Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. 4 days later she calls the cops and 2 days after that I'm arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I've never felt so betrayed. After a couple days I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I can't help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problems I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problems I would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I'm spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple days and then I'm pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You've always been a huge help Reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point. If convicted which I most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible. Hell I'll probably lose my current job once my name begins to get drug through the mud... Idk where I'm going with this just really needed to vent to someone that isn't gonna just tell me keep your chin up and things will get better like my friends and family. They just don't understand the dark place that I'm in right now.

The poster mentions feeling depressed for the past 15 years, as well as feeling like they don't fit in anywhere. They also mention spiraling out of control and planning to end their life. These are all signs of depression. Additionally, they mention feeling betrayed by their girlfriend and being arrested for domestic battery, which can also contribute to feelings of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[1, 2, 3]","[2, 1, 2]"

1. The poster mentions feeling depressed most of the time. 
2. They also mention struggling with addiction to porn as a way to feel happy, which is a common coping mechanism for individuals with depression. 
3. They also express feelings of losing themselves, losing interest in life, and potentially losing whatever they have left. 
4. These are all indicators of depression and suggest that the poster may be struggling with their mental health.","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 2]","[2, 3, 3]","[1, 3, 2]"
"extreme sadness whenever seeing anything happy Hello, this has been bothering me for a while and i have no idea what is this but when i ever i read or see anything happy like a happy scene or a happy story from some random comment i feel a huge wave of sadness wash over me and i feel like crying, why? what is going on? (i am not sure if this belongs to here but if not i don't mind it being deleted and sorry for breaking rules.)",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, the extreme sadness the poster experiences when seeing anything happy is a sign of depression. Depression can cause people to feel sad or hopeless even in situations that are typically associated with happiness. 

Furthermore, the fact that the poster is unsure of what is causing these emotions also suggests a lack of control or understanding of their own mental state, which is common in individuals experiencing depression. 

Lastly, the poster expresses their concern about their emotional state, which can also be a sign of depression as people with depression often struggle with feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of control over their emotions. 

Overall, while this post may not give a complete picture of the poster's mental health, the signs of extreme sadness, lack of control, and concern for their own emotional state are consistent with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]"
"Is it normal that my parents won't let me travel alone? Hello, everyone!! I live in Portugal and my favorite band isn't playing in my country so I decided I wanted to see them in Madrid or Paris...

There are no indications in the post that the poster is experiencing symptoms of depression. They express frustration and confusion over their parents' behavior, but overall their tone is clear and coherent. They describe their desire to travel and see their favorite band, indicating some level of excitement or enthusiasm. Additionally, they mention that they have considered different options for their trip, which shows some level of planning and problem-solving ability. Overall, the poster appears to be experiencing a difficult situation, but not one that is indicative of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 2, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"

The poster does not express any symptoms of depression in this post. They are struggling to get over a friendship and feeling hurt because the friend treats other friends well but not them. However, they are able to identify the problem and take action by ending the friendship. They are also seeking advice to cope with the pain, which shows proactive steps towards healing.

"Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist. So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis. So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime. So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work. So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all. I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon. Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive. Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it. Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what's happening. **tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish. Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future? QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)",1,"Yes.

Reasoning: The poster was diagnosed with depression and has been taking escitalopram for it. They also mention experiencing lethargy, lack of focus, and being ""consciously unconscious"" before starting medication. These are common symptoms of depression. Even though the poster reports feeling fine after stopping escitalopram, depression can manifest differently in each individual and it's important to discuss any changes in medication with a doctor.","[3, 3, 2]","[2, 2, 2]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 2]"

Although they express their frustration and confusion about their sister's infidelity and the fallout from it, they do not mention any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness which are commonly associated with depression.

"Random girl asked me awful question today. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but I need to get this off my chest. I’ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now and I’ve had my highs and my lows. Recently I’ve been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up, but we’re still friends and she supports me. And my birthday is coming up soon so I was looking forward to that. Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked “Are you a serial killer?” That’s when my heart sank. I had just shaved and I realize I’m not the best looking guy in the world, but I didn’t know that’s how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home. I don’t know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit. I’m trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I’m just shocked that someone could say that. Sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile. I don’t know if this is the right sub for this either, I just needed to get this off my chest.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. First, they stated that they have struggled with depression for three years. This alone suggests a history of depression. Additionally, they mention having highs and lows, which is a common experience for individuals with depression. They also mention that they have been doing okay recently, despite a breakup with their girlfriend, which may indicate that they have been struggling with depression consistently. Finally, the extreme emotional reaction to the encounter with the girl in Subway, including breaking down and crying, indicates that their mental health may be fragile and that the incident triggered a negative emotional response.

Reasoning: 
1. The poster mentions feeling ""really depressed"", which is an indication of a low mood.
2. The poster lists coping mechanisms, which suggests that they struggle with managing their depressive symptoms.
3. The poster contrasts ""healthy coping mechanisms"" with ""unhealthy coping mechanisms"", indicating awareness of the potential harm that can come from poor coping strategies.
4. The act of cooking an intricate meal is described as a purposeful activity that gets the poster out of the house. This suggests difficulty with motivation and engagement in daily activities, which can be a symptom of depression.

"Ending a 6 year friendship over her husband I [24F] am not sure how I feel about my friend’s behavior [28F] and I’m considering ending our friendship because of it. A little backstory, I’ve known her almost 7 years. We met through our boyfriends (they’re our exes now) and we used to do double dates and a lot of couple-y activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that. She and I stayed friends despite the break-ups with our boyfriends at the time. But our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule. She usually works 40-60 hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for 18 months so I didn’t always get to see her or hang out as much as I would have liked. But we’ve kept in touch through social media. I’ve always expressed a desire to hang out more, like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but she’s either too busy or financially strapped to do it. So typically we either see each other on our birthdays and that’s about it. The problem I’m having is that she’s married to this guy she met 4 years ago and I’ve been single for 5 years. I have a FWB [25M] who I’ve been in a “situationship” with for 18 months. I kept that a secret from her because it’s not a real relationship and I’m not sure if it’ll ever become one. She’s met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and I were out at a store. Ever since she became aware of his existence, she’s been pressuring me to plan “double dates” like going to the drive-ins to see the new Star Wars Movie or coming over to their house for Redbox movies and dinner. I already told her that’s not really the type of relationship that I have. I’ve mentioned the idea of all 4 of us hanging out to him casually to see if he’d be interested but he doesn’t want to do it. When I told her that I rather she and I just go to the movies together or girls’ night over at my place, she said she can’t because she wants to spend time with her husband when she’s not busy working. I feel like she’s not really going to spend time with me unless I give in and do “couples” activities. I just feel like she and I are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it'd be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who doesn't seem to want to do things just the two of us. Is it wrong of me not to want to be friends because of this?",0,"No. 

The poster does not show any signs of depression. 

Firstly, the post does not mention any symptoms of depression such as low mood, lack of interest in activities, loss of appetite or changes in sleep patterns. 

Secondly, the issue presented in the post is related to the poster's friendship and not to their mental health. While the writer expresses frustration, disappointment and uncertainty about the future of their friendship, they do not exhibit symptoms of depression.

Hello to anyone out there, I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically. It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me. Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock. I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim. I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it. If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life.

3. Loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities: The poster mentions that they used to love playing video games and spending time with others but no longer find joy in those activities.

4. Feelings of worthlessness: The poster repeatedly uses negative self-talk and believes they are a ""piece of shit"" and ""worthless.""

5. Social withdrawal: The poster says they have no friends or acquaintances, indicating a lack of social support.

6. Suicidal thoughts: The poster talks about wanting to run off a bridge and end their life, which is a dangerous sign of depression. Overall, the combination of these symptoms strongly suggests that the poster is experiencing depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"I thought I'd share two quotes that I liked/felt I could relate to. I don't know why I feel like sharing them here, but maybe somebody can take something away from them.

The second goes as ""What do you do from morning to night? I endure myself.""",1,"Yes.

The poster's choice of quotes from Emil Cioran's *The Trouble of Being Born*, a work that deals with existential dread and nihilism, suggests a tendency towards darker thoughts and emotions. The first quote, ""It is not worth the bother of killing yourself, since you always kill yourself too late,"" could be interpreted as a resigned acceptance of death or a dismissive attitude towards life, indicating that the poster may be struggling with feelings of hopelessness or despair. Moreover, their decision to share these quotes without much context or explanation suggests a lack of interest in engaging with others or seeking help, which can also be associated with depression. The second quote, ""What do you do from morning to night? I endure myself,"" similarly conveys a sense of solitude and self-loathing, further indicating the poster's potentially troubled state of mind.

3. The mention of wanting to be dead already is a significant red flag for depression. This indicates that the poster may be experiencing suicidal thoughts, which is a serious symptom of depression.

The post conveys a deep sense of grief and loss that the poster has struggled with for almost seven years. The emotions are still raw, as evidenced by the vivid recollection of the day they lost their fiancé. The fact that the pain slowly faded away over time indicates that the poster was recovering from the loss, but the sudden and unexpected death of their fiancé's father has triggered a resurgence of intense emotions. The use of profanity also suggests emotional distress, as does the hope of seeing their loved ones again one day.

"26 thinking of moving family upset Okay so this past 5 months have been overwhelming. I’ve had a lot of major things happen. I got married in October and over the past year I’ve been connecting with my father and half brothers (who I just consider brotthers) and that whole side off the family. My dads never been apart of my life. I saw him probably about 4 times out of my 26 years on earth. The last time until this past week I saw my dad was when I was 10 so 16 years ago. That was also the last time I ever flew on a plane. I decided to fly down about two weeks ago for a week and I had such a good time connecting with my brothers and my oldest brothers wife and my nephew and grandparents and everyone! I loved the idea of everyone together closely and always at each others houses and I got along so well with my brothers and it was really nice. My brother and sister in law decide to that they’re going to move back to Florida where my dad and dads family is and they all really want me to move there. They love the idea of us getting close as a family and setting traditions and spending holidays together. Honestly I love that idea. My problem is my mother raised me, she’s always been there for me. She has nobody other than me. She doesn’t even have a car I drive her places. My grandmother who is also soo important to me she’s my second mother she’s been in a nursing home for 10 years and she’s confused a lot but still not that confused. The thought of leaving them makes me want to cry and I feel like I couldn’t. My mom would feel so betrayed and angry at me. She’s already feeling a little hurt because I’m getting closer with my dad that family. Which is wrong but she has a lot of issues of her own. The thought of leaving my grandma I could never. :( I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never left NY my husband also has his father here and his father would hate me if I brought “his son” away. My husband acts like he dose not care but ofcose he must. I just don’t know what to do I feel so stuck like if I even considered moving I’d feel so selfish and horrible. I couldn’t leave my mom and I feel like she wouldn’t come with me she’d be so angry that I was “choosing my father who did nothing for me and his family who ignored me” over staying near her.

The poster expresses feelings of being overwhelmed, stuck, and guilty, but these emotions do not necessarily indicate depression. The poster still expresses a desire to form good relationships with their family and enjoy life, which is not aligned with the hallmark symptoms of depression such as apathy and loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities. Additionally, the poster seems to have reasonable explanations for their emotions related to the stress of navigating complex family dynamics, rather than exhibiting persistent feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[3, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"

1. The poster's plans for Valentine's Day involve laying in bed, which is a sign of withdrawing from other activities.
2. Feeling lonely is a symptom of depression.
3. Trying to cry but being unable to suggests a lack of emotional expression and a sense of hopelessness.
4. Realizing they will ""never cry again"" indicates a belief that they will never feel better or that it's pointless to try.
5. Hating oneself is a sign of low self-esteem, which is often present in depression.
6. Debating whether to talk to someone suggests a sense of isolation and difficulty reaching out for help.
7. Laying in bed for the rest of the day is a sign of decreased motivation and energy, which are also symptoms of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"

I need fiction to get me through a day or else I go completely numb. So uhh is this a problem? Or is it normal?",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. The language used, such as ""miserable reality"" and ""lifelessly struggling,"" suggests a negative and hopeless outlook on their current situation. The fact that they only feel alive when watching anime or listening to music also indicates a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment in their daily life, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the need for fiction to get them through the day suggests a difficulty in coping with reality, which is another symptom of depression. Overall, the post implies a pattern of low mood and a lack of enjoyment in everyday activities, which are key indicators of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"

"My dad is getting older, in bad shape and is too stubborn to do anything about it I love my parents, but over the past 10 years my dad has been gaining weight and eating junk that has made him become pretty unhealthy. About 4 years ago, he suffered from a heart attack before I headed to work; he collapsed in front of my mom and I had to run out the door and knock on both my neighbors doors since they both new CPR. Luckily, the paramedics came in time and he was able to survive through surgery. He's on medication now and all of his tests have come through positive, but he is still overweight. He's 61 and I realize he's not getting any younger. My mother and I have been trying to get him to eat healthier and stop drinking so much, he drinks chardonnay every night and a lot of it a week. EVERY time we bring it up, he immediately diverts the topic to something else, and blames us for being negative and to be more ""positive"". He says he works too much and that we are just ganging up on him. Psychologically I believe he's just so stubborn that he won't ever admit to actually being unhealthy and doing something about it. He's tried to workout but he never makes much progress. I want my dad to live for as long as possible, but he's just so incredibly stubborn and toxic about it that eventually i'm afraid he's not going to last much longer, we are both incredibly frustrated. Our doctor who monitors him has even told my mother "" Your father is a very nice man, but if he continues doing what he's doing, you need to raise your life insurance"". What do I do?",0,"No.

Reasoning: Although the poster expresses concern and frustration about their father's health and behavior, there is no indication of sadness or loss of interest in activities that are typically enjoyed. The post primarily focuses on the father's stubbornness and resistance to change, rather than the poster's own emotional state. Additionally, the poster does not mention feeling hopeless or worthless, which are common symptoms of depression. Overall, while the post indicates a difficult and stressful situation, there is no clear indication of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"
"I want to kill myself a lot these days I’m just so disconnected from everything and everyone. I can’t meet new people, and it is making me hate my life. The only girls I meet are through work, and I’d rather keep these relationships professional. Girls I meet other ways never last, and I don’t know how to stop talking to them. I’m always holding onto the shred of hope that we will pick up where we left off, when I know this isn’t going to happen. I can’t let go of the relationships that didn’t work because I am unable to create new ones. I’m alone as I’ve ever been. I can’t even have guy friends because I’m bad with competition. I don’t even realize it, it’s all subconscious. I’m an asshole and I’ve just been a dick to people who just don’t deserve it. I’ve been so selfish. I guess I can be happy that I’ve started to make changes. They say change your habits and your mind will follow. Well I’ve improved my habits greatly over the past year, so why am I still a piece of shit. Why am I still unable to let go of the failed relationships. Why am I unable to move forward from all this.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

1. The statement ""I want to kill myself"" is a clear indication of suicidal ideation, which is a common symptom of depression.
2. The statement ""I’m just so disconnected from everything and everyone"" suggests feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are also symptoms of depression.
3. The difficulty the poster expresses in creating new relationships and letting go of failed ones is indicative of low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness, which are common in depression.
4. The self-critical statements, such as ""I’m an asshole"" and ""I’ve just been a dick to people"" are also indicative of depression, as individuals with depression often feel guilty and see themselves negatively.
5. The notion that the poster has made changes, but still feels like a ""piece of shit"" suggests feelings of hopelessness and a sense of lack of control, which again are common in depression. 

Overall, the post reveals symptoms of depression including suicidal ideation, feelings of isolation and worthlessness, self-criticism, and a sense of hopelessness.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]"
"Intense feelings of not wanting to exist/ wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever I'm a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school. I've been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it. I feel like I don't have any actual friends even though I go out a lot, and I feel like I have no impact on other people's lives, like they can go on so easily without me being there. On top of that, I feel like I don't belong anywhere since leaving highschool. I feel like I don't have a place in college, even though I got into my first choice school. However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything. This is mostly just a flood of thoughts that are always in my head, but I just wanted to give my two cents to see if anyone relates to these thoughts/feelings",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression.

"How do I help my granny? She is confined to a chair most of her day. She used to love to do arts and crafts, but now suffers from arthritis. I have considered buying large print mysteries, but not knowing how a story ends makes her nervous. She tends to spend her days in the living room watching House Hunters or reruns of her favorite ""good, clean"" murders (JAG, Hawaii Five-O, NCIS). She refuses to try new things, or will try only to abandon the idea a few days or weeks later. She claims she doesn't want to sit and rot, but that's what she's doing. Please help with any ideas.",0,"No, the poster does not show any signs of depression. 

Reasoning: The poster expresses concern for their grandmother's well-being and provides a detailed background of her current situation. However, there is no indication of the poster feeling unmotivated, sad, or hopeless, which are common symptoms of depression. The tone of the post is seeking solutions and wanting to help, rather than exhibiting any signs of depression.

"My long-term relationship ended without a breakup conversation. My bf just ghosted me and stopped talking to me without any explanation. I’m feeling very depressed and need some advice? I (22/f) found out through Instagram that my long-term bf (23/m) was cheating on me with multiple women. I’ve noticed the last month together he’s been distant and acting strangely. Now all his strange behavior makes sense. After I found out I texted him letting him know that I found out about the cheating and that I lost all respect for him. He didn’t even bother responding or giving me a call. There was no text back, no phone call back. Zero conversation. I sent the text a week ago. I loved him so much and I can’t believe after all this time together he is just going to ghost me and leave me without a final conversation. Him ignoring me is so awful and selfish and is mind-boggling to me. I went ahead and deleted his number and deleted him off social media. Moving forward, how can I feel better about the whole situation? I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely awful. I’ve been crying so much and just want to start feeling better.",1,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, the poster describes feeling ""very depressed"" in the first sentence of the post. 

Furthermore, the poster expresses feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and guilt throughout the post, such as feeling ""sick to [her] stomach"" and ""crying so much."" The fact that the breakup happened suddenly without closure may also be contributing to her feelings of depression.

Lastly, the poster is seeking advice on how to feel better, indicating that she is struggling to cope with her feelings and searching for ways to improve her mental state.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[1, 3, 2]","[2, 3, 2]"
"I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here. For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment. I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years?",1,"Yes. The post describes a persistent lack of enjoyment in activities previously enjoyed, thoughts of self-harm, and contemplating the pointlessness of life. These are all common symptoms of depression. The poster also expresses a desire for help and relief from these feelings, which indicates a level of distress and a need for support. While no official diagnosis can be made without professional evaluation, the symptoms described in the post suggest the presence of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
