"A vent more than advice post my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me"" half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his."" and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row. not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me. tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks.",0," No Explanation Required

When will this inescapable wait ever end? I feel as though this is never ending and nothing good will ever come out of it. I’m underserving. I have both a long-term mental illness and a long-term physical illness. One’s willpower is limited. I struggle everyday both physically and mentally/emotionally. It’s been years. My physical illness affects my mental illness and vice versa but they are offend uncontrollable! I suffer from chronic low self-esteem due to my illnesses. I don’t know I just feel hopeless and helpless. My willpower feels drained. I don’t know how much longer I can keep holding on. It’s not holding on that’s difficult. What’s difficult is holding on when there may be no meaning to it. What if I hold on with all my will and I find out there’s nothing to it. My whole life would’ve just been meaningless suffering.

"does it ever feel like your friends arent really there? I genuinely care for and love my friends so I regularly ask them how they're doing on messenger since they all live so far away. I know my friends struggle with depression so I make it a point to contact them and let them know I'm here for them. But most times I am left on ""read"" or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They don't really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I'm doing. I hope I don't sound selfish in any way, but it just feels weird to care so much for people who don't seem to care that much for you. It hurts sometimes that I also struggle with depression but have no one to talk to..",1," Yes ; the poster exhibits signs of a person struggling with and dealing with depressive symptoms. They ask how their friends are doing and generally worry that they are not getting the support they need. They feel seen and heard, even if it is frustrating and frustrating they cannot initiate conversation with friends or hear snippets of what they might be going through.

There is no evidence of any ""selfishness"" on the part of the poster. Comparing their friends to the poster's personal struggle with depression and anxiety, they may feel a lack of companionship or want to reach out. It is reasonable that they want to talk and be heard, and their concern that they are not getting their needs met is understandable in light of their battle. They are reaching out but cannot seem to find a way to bridge the gap from one to the other and may feel bad about wanting more.

Yes ; the poster exhibits signs of a person struggling with and dealing with depressive symptoms in line with the emotions reported in their post. They are reaching out and potentially feeling ignored, talked over, and unheard.

"When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond.

I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There's nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I don't know what else to say. It's the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I don't even look forward to coming home from work because it's not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It's all the same dullness.

"I lost a friend I just graduated high school and all throughout high school I have struggled with depression and anxiety. At my school, there was this really cute girl who I had a crush on. She was in two of my classes and I got know her pretty well. Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she wasn't into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she's really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school. It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she didn't really seem interested in being my friend. Now it's summer and I've tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together. I want to tell her how I feel and that I wish I could be her friend still but I'm worried it will just create a bad situation. I really don't know what to do.",1," 


Yes, the poster exhibits signs of depression and anxiety. 

Opening: ""It makes me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes.""

The poster talked about how she feels about his best friend, who is a girl, and how her presence makes their day better. They also talked about how much their lives are better when she is in the picture. These show signs of loneliness, which could come out of low self-esteem or depression.

Feeling nostalgic? Does anyone else obsess over a point of time in their life when they felt like they were truly happy? For me the last time in my life when I felt like I was truly happy was 2013 and 2014 (mostly the summers) Ever since then life has changed so much. My depression got worse than ever. I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what?

"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally: * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person. It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me? I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself, and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness, meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with. I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone.",1,"

"Can’t fix anything in my life I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self. Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that. All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy. The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me.",1," Yes --- A possible reason for seeking help is feelings of worthlessness and despair. The poster uses metaphorical language (in the sense that it is text that is copied verbatim and used as a measure of expression) to describe the hopeless and harsh reality of her existence. She often uses hyperbole in a self-deprecating and humorous manner, suggesting that she occasionally has periods where they very happy. She asks an unrelated question (What do you not do?) that suggests that she is trying to compare her inability to form healthy relationships and friendships with others of her age vs. a world where other people manage to find acceptance. She believes that the cause of herself and others' behavior stems from societal influence and they are following society's rules. In the final sentence, she expresses the following emotion: ""A real person. A complete shell of what could have been a person.""

This goes on to say that the victim is not sure how to react when they meet the woman they are at fault towards and the woman will apologize and act remorseful, but the victim no longer believes or trusts her.","[2, 1, 2]","[1, 1, 0]","[2, 1, 0]","[2, 1, 0]"
"How to stop being friend with a person that i'm envious of ?? Hi... I'm a university student who befriend with a person who also study in the same university as me as well as enrolling in the same bachelor degree. When i befriend with this person, i just feel a lot of inconveniences and jealousy in my life. Honestly, i often feel envy of his high scores, actually sometimes i even help him to do an assignment (like sending him a copy of my assignment) which annoyingly also makes him get a higher score than me. He is a good guy, but i just really don't want to befriend with him anymore because of this kind of inconveniences and jealousy. I know, maybe some of you see me as the ""Toxic Friend"" or the ""Bad Guy"" here, but, i don't really care. The question is... How to stop being friend with this person in a gradual way ?? If i stop helping him in doing assignments, will it help me to break this friendship ??",0," ---------------------------------------------------------------- Activity

"I don't care about anything. I have been really trying to figure how to stop feeling this way and I've seen a pattern which is just do something. Be create. Do something you like. Shit like that. I don't think people understand that I don't care about anything. I don't care. I don't like anything. I tolerate it. I don't like my favorite shows. I don't my old hobbies. I don't like the people I used to like. I don't like anything. I don't care about anything. I feel empty. Like all the things that made me who I am is gone. I don't care. How is ""doing I like"" helpful when I don't like anything? When I don't about anything I am doing? That is the reason I stopped doing first place. How is doing those things again going help me? This is like the biggest suggestion I have seen and I think pretty unhelpful. I can't just make myself care. I've tried. I wish I could care about those things again but I can't so suggesting to do those things, as if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. ""Oh your depressed? Just do what you like."" No. I don't want to. I don't want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and can't. To want to care and you just can't. I've tried medication and therapy.

"How do you get a job after over a year of unemployment? F early 20s. I never finished college, came home, and I've been so depressed that I haven't done anything since I left school in 2016. I'm a really hard worker and I've always been liked by my bosses, but I don't feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs I've had I kind of - just - abandoned. I would get to a point where I couldn't handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if I wanted to come back during a break from school and I would never call back.

Yes, the poster is low and talking about the way that it feels to not have any credentials.

Describe your reasoning step by step

- The poster revealed that when they left school they had bought into the notion that they were worthless.

- The poster said that they were paranoid and shame-filled and isolated.
- The poster expressed low self-esteem, and a lack of motivation to do anything.

- They expressed that they were depressed and may not have seen any point in continuing past where they were in the past.

- The poster interrupted themselves, with their emotions flowing through the post before bouncing back when the poster says ""I don't know how to get out of""- the ""-I don't know how to get out of."" indicates that the poster is not sure about anything and is doing nothing but thinking about what the ""right"" thing to do should be.","[2, 2, 2]","[1, 2, 2]","[1, 2, 1]","[1, 2, 1]"

"I don鈥檛 want to lose friendship of 10 years but I think it鈥檚 going that way Hi guys, I don鈥檛 usually do this but I literally feel like I have nowhere else to vent. Ok. I have been friends with this person for 10 years since we were teenagers. We both clicked over time through going to the same school and I really liked her personality. We ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and I let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to. After graduation she鈥檚 spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much, though we have met up when she鈥檚 been back. So the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but it鈥檚 been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didn鈥檛 want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didn鈥檛 reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if she鈥檚 busy and have stressed to her that I don鈥檛 want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and it鈥檚 basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding. The thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I can鈥檛 think of anything. I have questioned whether I鈥檓 getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that she鈥檚 suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldn鈥檛 be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other. But if for some mysterious reason she鈥檚 cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can I do? I basically sent her a message saying I wouldn鈥檛 try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that. I feel like I may never hear from her again and it really hurts. But what can I do? If something isn鈥檛 there anymore then it鈥檚 just not there. - A 20 something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit",0," No

"""I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either."" Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace. I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful. The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said ""alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?"" I'd say ""no thanks, I'm good"". With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole. I should stop before I become some combination of ""old man yells at cloud"" and ""whiny emo stereotype"". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others wasn't there. But it is, so here I am.",1," Yes

'I feel alone and everything makes me want to cry' 

The poster demonstrates that he does feel some confusion and lack of belief during this time. It could be seen as more than just feeling out of place in one's life. It could be depression that he is experiencing because of his feeling that this is all there is. This may lead to low emotions which may develop into hernia.

'I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either'

The person is showing signs of not wanting to live in a world that is experienced with so much lack and this weighs on him heavily. This leads to low emotions which lead to depression which ever again develop into hernia. No","[1, 2, 2]","[0, 1, 1]","[1, 1, 1]","[0, 1, 1]"
"Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I鈥檓 sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship. A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more. After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn鈥檛 even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now. 3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren鈥檛 friends anymore) and we鈥檝e been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend鈥檚 prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don鈥檛 physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn鈥檛 matter but it still bothers me. I鈥檝e tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again. I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I鈥檓 also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I鈥檝e nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can鈥檛 seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I鈥檝e distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can鈥檛 make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now. I鈥檓 looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds!",1,"

I've never felt more alone in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move. I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore. I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship. I just want to feel important to someone. Or at least okay enough with myself that I don't need the validation of a relationship to feel valuable.,1,"

The person posting the facebook post appears to be feeling suicidal and depressed. They are also not able to express their feelings of depression to others, as they do not allow people who mean a lot to them in their life to get close to them. They mention how social media has worsened the way they feel, how often they need to vent feelings to people without letting on those thoughts, and how they try and live feeling vibrations around them. In their confessing of talking to themselves, they talk about the message they get from people of, ""you're going to be all right."" Sometimes the poster feels like they are outgrowing friends, similar to how they think they are outgrowing their mother, or the daughter in their relationship.

I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just 鈥榖eing honest鈥? 2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn鈥檛 tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn鈥檛 want to ditch her if she hadn鈥檛. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn鈥檛 bother me (it didn鈥檛, I was upset because she didn鈥檛 care about me) and that she wouldn鈥檛 care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy 鈥榳e鈥檒l sor-ry鈥? 3: Another friend of mine and Abby鈥檚 (it鈥檚 a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn鈥檛 come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn鈥檛 even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I鈥檝e had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off.

I don鈥檛 even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, 鈥淵ou realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.鈥?I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I鈥檓 not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, 鈥淗ey, I heard you were followed...鈥?or ANYTHING. Just straight up 鈥渋t鈥檚 your fault I have no sympathy.鈥?Like, Hey, nice to see you too. Either way, we鈥檙e not talking anymore.

"It's become a personality trait Depression has become part of my identity. As much as I'd like to say it doesn't define me, it really does, it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences. I know we have one life and that there's nothing after that but that fact isn't motivating. In many moments like this I'm convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive, short range, unchanging emotions is my proof. Feels completely pointless and childish to even vent, me writing this feels ridiculous.",1," 

Yes

The poster writes about the many emotions he felt such as 'feels completely pointless and childish to even vent, me writing this feels ridiculous'. The poster also provides examples of times when he felt depressed, for instance 'In many moments like this I'm convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive, short range, unchanging emotions is my proof.'. He expresses that despite having these thoughts he is constantly living life as though he believes in something. The poster threatens to end conversation with the post and often is lacking in the motivation to live, but he continues to live the way he believes in. The poster furthermore realizes the affect that depression has on his life and shows signs of thoughtfulness such as 'we have one life and that there's nothing after that'. 

I believe in Karma and that it is people's attitude that good things happen to hardworking and deserving people.

"Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do. I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one. My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth. I honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up. I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly.

I didn't think they were working and I definitely wasn't where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God.

"I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all. I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems. I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample: - I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) - There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day. I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious. The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together. - I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so."" - I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. - Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events. I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities. Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband. After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump. I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know. I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human. I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure. I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off. I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine.

We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc. Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie.

I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative. While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself. All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode. I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.

"GF stopped taking antidepressants So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive.

I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it鈥檒l help the 鈥渃hemicals leave her body.鈥?I don鈥檛 know what to do.

"hot and cold friend I do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time. Some of them have developed into stronger friendships (we bond on more than just gaming). I became close with one guy in particular and I'd say he's become one of my best friends. We met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation, we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and IM. Initially, we texted all the time but I've been noticing very recently, his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent. I get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but I feel like things have changed. I had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate; always asking about my day, initiating conversations, and just being a kind friend in general. If it's been a couple of hours and i haven't replied, he'd message me to check up. I admit it was a bit intense at first but I had gotten used to it and reciprocated. But now that he's kind of dropped off, I feel like I am becoming overbearing and that's the last thing I want to be. I feel like I'm putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days. I've brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just aren't what they used to be. On top of that, I am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me...I don't nearly game as much as he does so when I do come online, we usually play games together. Sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more, we game with each other. We don't really play in groups much because he's a bit of an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable in large group settings. The other day, I was invited to play with a friend we made online. Prior to this, my friend and I had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early. But me not wanting to play with our new friend alone, i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me...but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird. Eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so I was happy by the time I called it a night and found that all of them were bonding.

"I just don't know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I'm sure I have been happy some time along the way but I can't remember. I think most of the ""good"" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer. I've dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I've been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point. I am just completely exhausted at this point and don't know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doesn't help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I'm interested in. They can't understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task. They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I'm pretty sure the main reason that I'm not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just wouldn't be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle. As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just don't know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now. All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away.

"I feel so lost Hi. I'm 15 year old girl from India and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everybody is passionate about something right? I'm not. I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do.

She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works. She's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around. It's getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while I have nothing to compare, how shitty of a person would I be if I distanced myself from her for my own mental well-being?",0,"

"Finished my goodbye letters. Would just like to vent a little before I hang up my hat... For the last two months I went through hell with my relationship to my GF that I was planning on proposing to right before this all began. Since May she's been telling me how she's depressed and doesn't know why and that our relationship is failing because of it. I did absolutely everything I could to help even changing so many things about myself. This went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eyes things were turning around for the better. Well, June 29th I found out the reason for all this was that she was talking to a co-worker that lives down the street and began sleeping with him while I was at work. Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. 4 days later she calls the cops and 2 days after that I'm arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I've never felt so betrayed. After a couple days I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I can't help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problems I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problems I would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I'm spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple days and then I'm pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You've always been a huge help Reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point. If convicted which I most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible. Hell I'll probably lose my current job once my name begins to get drug through the mud... Idk where I'm going with this just really needed to vent to someone that isn't gonna just tell me keep your chin up and things will get better like my friends and family. They just don't understand the dark place that I'm in right now. I've dealt with what I believe to have been mild depression for about the last 15 years living in a very racist area and being half fillipino and half white. I've never truly felt like I fit in anywhere and am just tired. I'm ready for peace.",1,"

"Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist. So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis. So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime. So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work. So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all. I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon. Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive. Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it. Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what's happening. **tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish. Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future? QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)",1,"

"Ending a 6 year friendship over her husband I [24F] am not sure how I feel about my friend鈥檚 behavior [28F] and I鈥檓 considering ending our friendship because of it. A little backstory, I鈥檝e known her almost 7 years. We met through our boyfriends (they鈥檙e our exes now) and we used to do double dates and a lot of couple-y activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that. She and I stayed friends despite the break-ups with our boyfriends at the time. But our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule. She usually works 40-60 hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for 18 months so I didn鈥檛 always get to see her or hang out as much as I would have liked. But we鈥檝e kept in touch through social media. I鈥檝e always expressed a desire to hang out more, like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but she鈥檚 either too busy or financially strapped to do it. So typically we either see each other on our birthdays and that鈥檚 about it. The problem I鈥檓 having is that she鈥檚 married to this guy she met 4 years ago and I鈥檝e been single for 5 years. I have a FWB [25M] who I鈥檝e been in a 鈥渟ituationship鈥?with for 18 months. I kept that a secret from her because it鈥檚 not a real relationship and I鈥檓 not sure if it鈥檒l ever become one. She鈥檚 met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and I were out at a store. Ever since she became aware of his existence, she鈥檚 been pressuring me to plan 鈥渄ouble dates鈥?like going to the drive-ins to see the new Star Wars Movie or coming over to their house for Redbox movies and dinner. I already told her that鈥檚 not really the type of relationship that I have. I鈥檝e mentioned the idea of all 4 of us hanging out to him casually to see if he鈥檇 be interested but he doesn鈥檛 want to do it. When I told her that I rather she and I just go to the movies together or girls鈥?night over at my place, she said she can鈥檛 because she wants to spend time with her husband when she鈥檚 not busy working. I feel like she鈥檚 not really going to spend time with me unless I give in and do 鈥渃ouples鈥?activities. I just feel like she and I are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it'd be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who doesn't seem to want to do things just the two of us.

"I think i'm okay, but in reality and in hindsight I am completely not okay. I think I am literally dying day by day. Hello to anyone out there, I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically. It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me. Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock. I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim. I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it. If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I'm hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest. I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I'm lonely, i'm always sad and i'm just a piece of shit that is worthless. Good Bye everyone. I hope you've all had an awesome day.

I've been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it. I feel like I don't have any actual friends even though I go out a lot, and I feel like I have no impact on other people's lives, like they can go on so easily without me being there. On top of that, I feel like I don't belong anywhere since leaving highschool. I feel like I don't have a place in college, even though I got into my first choice school. However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything. This is mostly just a flood of thoughts that are always in my head, but I just wanted to give my two cents to see if anyone relates to these thoughts/feelings",1,"

"How do I help my granny? She is confined to a chair most of her day. She used to love to do arts and crafts, but now suffers from arthritis. I have considered buying large print mysteries, but not knowing how a story ends makes her nervous. She tends to spend her days in the living room watching House Hunters or reruns of her favorite ""good, clean"" murders (JAG, Hawaii Five-O, NCIS). She refuses to try new things, or will try only to abandon the idea a few days or weeks later. She claims she doesn't want to sit and rot, but that's what she's doing. Please help with any ideas.",0,"

No, strongly indicating that the poster does not show any signs of general depression, only that the poster is afraid their grandmother is showing signs of depression.","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 0, 3]","[3, 1, 3]","[2, 1, 3]"
"My long-term relationship ended without a breakup conversation. My bf just ghosted me and stopped talking to me without any explanation. I鈥檓 feeling very depressed and need some advice? I (22/f) found out through Instagram that my long-term bf (23/m) was cheating on me with multiple women. I鈥檝e noticed the last month together he鈥檚 been distant and acting strangely. Now all his strange behavior makes sense. After I found out I texted him letting him know that I found out about the cheating and that I lost all respect for him. He didn鈥檛 even bother responding or giving me a call. There was no text back, no phone call back. Zero conversation. I sent the text a week ago. I loved him so much and I can鈥檛 believe after all this time together he is just going to ghost me and leave me without a final conversation. Him ignoring me is so awful and selfish and is mind-boggling to me. I went ahead and deleted his number and deleted him off social media. Moving forward, how can I feel better about the whole situation? I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely awful. I鈥檝e been crying so much and just want to start feeling better.",1,"

"I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here. For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment. I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years?",1,"

Yes, the poster exhibits emotional and a growing apathy.","[0, 2, 3]","[0, 0, 1]","[0, 1, 3]","[0, 1, 1]"
