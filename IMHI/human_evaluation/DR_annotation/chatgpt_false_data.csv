"My mother and her tragically unlucky family Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance. My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go; So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two. But it gets unluckier. So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later) 1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that). But again, it gets unluckier. Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal. So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family. So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was. So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband. I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born. The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff. So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?",0,"Yes. 

The language used in the post is highly emotional and includes phrases such as ""totally gobsmacked,"" ""unluckier,"" ""tragic loss,"" ""creeps me out,"" and ""depressing as fuck."" These words suggest a sense of hopelessness and despair, which are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the post focuses on the negative events in the family's history, which could indicate a tendency to ruminate on negative thoughts and experiences, which is another symptom of depression. Finally, the post includes information about a family member who is abusive and has addiction issues, which could suggest the poster has experienced trauma or difficult relationships in their personal life, which can also contribute to depression.","[3, 2, 3]","[1, 2, 2]","[1, 1, 1]","[2, 2, 2]"
"My best friend has completely cut me out of his life for a girl and i am feeling depressed Hey guys, ive known my best mate for 7 years and we finished high school and now both go to the same uni, we were so tight, like brothers. We were gym partners, helped other out with assignments, and hanged out so frequently. That was all until he got a girlfriend. He met with this chick like 5 months ago and i was pleased for the dude, he seemed happy. 5 months on he still seems so attached to his girl, he rarey texts me and we used to play xbox together but none of those happen anymore. On the rare occasion when we do go to hang out he is always on his phone texting his girl, infact even in the cinema we watched a movie he was literally texting her during the film... even on xbox i hear the phone go off every minute or so We done so much shit together.... i gave him a driving instructor with a family discount cos i knew the guy and he got his license now, i helped him raise $600 for a new pc, and even went into a lil business together where i invested and he knew the contacts. This dude was my brother basiclly and now he never has time for me, we were so damn close and i wish things could go back to how they were without this girl because she is so paranoid of him talking to another girl I dont get why he has done this to me, ive always been there for him and now he doesnt even respond to my messages, i see him active on facebook but doesnt even read messages... i helped this dude out so much in high school he was going to fail, i taught him some shit and thats how we got close and he passed literally because of me. I dont know what to do... i feel like we are becoming so dinstant and only communicate once a week or so, im feeling so depressed and mentally hurt.... TL;DR; : What shall i do? Shall i talk to him or just wait it out",0,"Yes. The poster expresses feeling depressed and mentally hurt about the situation with their best friend. They also mention feeling distant from their friend and that they don't know what to do.

"Please try watching The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross It may not have the same effect on you as it does me, hence why I say ""please try"". That show calms me, makes me feel better, and helps me sleep. Bob Ross has a soothing voice and I love his mindset. You can watch the entirety of the show on the official Bob Ross YouTube channel.",1,"No. 

Reasoning: 

The poster is expressing a positive emotion of feeling calm and better after watching The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross. They also seem to genuinely enjoy the show and the host's personality. There are no indications of negative emotions such as sadness or hopelessness, which are commonly associated with depression. Therefore, it can be concluded that the poster does not show any signs of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"
"I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth. We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me. I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting.",0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, they mention that they are working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, which could be a sign of unresolved trauma. Additionally, they express deep-seated anger and resentment towards their grandmother, despite the fact that she tries to make them happy. This may indicate a lack of enjoyment or pleasure in activities that would typically bring joy. Furthermore, the poster mentions feeling like a monster and experiencing guilt frequently - this negative self-talk is often associated with depression. Finally, their statement, ""I just wish this was not my life,"" suggests a pervasive feeling of hopelessness, which is often present in depression. Overall, the language and content of the post suggest depressive symptoms.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 2, 2]","[2, 2, 1]","[2, 2, 2]"
"How does it feel to have an abnormal next of kin? I have a brother who people call ""retarded"". But actually he's not. Just family - the one voluntarily has patience with him understand that. When I was a kid, I only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things. We were watching TV and the editors were discussing some news, instead of listening and talking about related topics (as normal people do) he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information. If it's your family's case, maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something, but mine did nothing. When I argued with him over such false information, my parents even stopped me and said ""Why do you have to argue with your poor brother?"" I thought they would never tell him what's wrong and what's right. At age of 10, once he told me to pack things up 'cause we would go for a trip with my mom's friends, I had no doubt and did exactly what he had said. Of course, one day later I found out he lied. At that moment, he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed. That's the moment I realized he's such an attention seeker, he's selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself. Since then, my parents never listen to me as I say he's not a fool, he's slippery even. And others saying I was blessed because all the bad luck on his place so I could live, study and be the only child that parents could be proud of. He's been living an easy life 'cause people are working their asses off out there but he just needs to call mom and things will be done. And none would want to resent him making mistakes 'cause ""he's retarded, just leave him"" they say. I envy him. Should I be stupid in order to be noticed by my parents?",0,"Yes.

The post expresses a sense of resentment towards the poster's brother and feelings of being overlooked by their parents. The poster also expresses envy towards their brother and a sense of hopelessness in being noticed or recognized by their parents. These feelings may suggest the presence of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[1, 1, 0]","[1, 1, 0]"

I have had quite an uncertain year since graduating, so maybe it is that quarter-life crisis. Have you been through this phase?",1,"No, the poster does not show any signs of depression. The emotion expressed in the post is a mix of nostalgia, sadness, and uncertainty. The poster is questioning whether their nostalgia is a way to escape their current feelings of uncertainty and seems to be experiencing a quarter-life crisis. However, there is no indication of any persistent feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or despair, which are common signs of depression. The poster is seeking insight and validation from others who may have been through a similar experience, suggesting a willingness to seek help and take action to improve their situation, which is not typical of someone experiencing depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[2, 2, 2]"
My friend wants to cut everybody off Hi all. I talked to a friend a few days ago who is going through depression and she told me she wants to cut all of her friends and family off. I am taken aback _ we__e known each other since primary school! I just don__ know what to say. She says it isn__ anything personal and she just wants to end all of her relationships. Has anyone dealt with something similar?,0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of being affected by their friend's depression. 

Firstly, the poster mentions that their friend is going through depression, which implies that the topic is causing emotional distress for both the friend and the poster. 

Additionally, the poster expresses being ""taken aback"" by their friend's desire to cut everyone off. This suggests that the situation is unexpected and may be causing feelings of shock or confusion. 

Furthermore, the poster mentions that they ""just don't know what to say,"" indicating a sense of helplessness or uncertainty about how to support their friend during this difficult time. 

Overall, while the post is primarily focused on the friend's depression, the language used suggests that the poster is also emotionally invested in the situation and may be experiencing their own feelings of sadness or concern.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 2, 2]","[1, 1, 1]","[2, 2, 0]"
"My bestfriend ruined my life. So, I am a 21 year old girl. I go to college, it's my third year and it all started two, almost three years. This girl, my ""best friend"" told me that her old friends from primary school came to see her and she invited me. I rejected it. I am very shy and anxious around people and she knew it. They were both boys, one of them being her old love interest and one of them... well. My future love interest, the man I thought my future. I've never been in a relationship, like I've said my depression and anxiety made me believe that I am not worth it and nobody is going to love me. So she asked that he wants to meet with me and how he can do that etc. I wanted to give my number to him, I told her that I would love to talk with him because she told me a lot about him. A basketball player -my favorite sports-, goes to San Francisco State University, loves motorcycles -like me- and wears all black -like me- and has blue eyes, dark hair etc. She told me that he doesn't use any social media, even his phone because he hated them as a kid too. I was like okay it's a oersonal preference. Like, at this point I wasn't serious. Because I didn't think he would like me. So I said let's try to talk with him because someone like him wouldn't like me anyway. On my 19th birthday I got an e-mail. It was from him. He was telling me happy birthday, how he wanted to write me and meet me. I was stupid, I flew with his message and we started talking. It was so beautiful. He was so sweet and kind. He was everything I wanted. Times go by, we decide to try ""us"" in a relationship. Mind you, until then I haven't seen him once, even though I asked to see his face. Not because I only care about physical stuff, because it was too good to be true. My mind, my mind wasn't accepting the fact that someone like him would like me. We started dating, talking each other 24/7 but without any Skype or calling. I haven't heard his voice once. One year passed, I totally fell in love, he told me he was in love and because of his family problems he couldn't open himself. Few things ruined me after our magical but almost ""it's nothing but a dream"" year. First he lied to me about visiting me 3 times. He told me that he gor the ticket and he was on the way to the airport. He never came. Second time I cried my heart out because of an accident. We were talking with my ""bestie"" the girl who met us, and she send me a conversation quotes. Her argument with one of her friends. When he sent an e-mail... The exact conversation she sent me was on the bottom of his mail. We used to send tons of hearts with each mail, I guess she forgot copying the hearts again. And sent me the conversation. Third time he decided to talk on Kik. You know after almost 1.5 years I wanted to speak normally, not with e-mails. I was so happy, I forgot everything he did to me, especially the mental abuse and fights about my male friends, I said yes open yourself to me, let me be with you etc. I was happy. A message came to me from an account with his initials. However without me having a chance to look at the message a notification about my bestie appeared on my phone, let's name her ""Aurora"" about opening a Kik account with his initials. I asked her what the fuck was going on and she told me it was a joke. He never send a message from Kik. Over time, my mental position got worse and worse. I'd hurt myself regularly, I'd cry at nights and I'd walk around without any emotions. Our friendship whit my ""bestie"" did end before me and he ended. When she got a new phone, her e-mail app gave an error. Until she fixed it he didn't mail me even once. Fourteen days. When her phone got fixed, he started writing me immediately. I knew it was her. I knew it was her from the beginning but I was too hopeful to believe that someone would love me. Now I'm here, with tons 谋f new friends, friends I've made after her i, because her rude actions and poisonous words left us alone in the class. However I cannot deal with it. I still hope that he was real. I cannot stand the idea about a HUMAN BEING can do such a thing to a person she called as friend. I cannot deal with it. I would love to have some advice. It's been 2 weeks since my second semester has started but I cannot go to school because she will be there. And I am afraid I may hurt myself or worse, I may hurt her at some point.",0,"Yes. 

The poster shows signs of depression through the following:

- Mentioning that they have depression and anxiety that made them believe they are not worth it and that nobody would love them.
- Describing themselves as having walked around without emotions and regularly hurting themselves.
- Indicating that their mental position got worse and worse over time.
- Expressing that they cannot deal with the situation and may hurt themselves or others.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 2]","[1, 1, 0]","[2, 2, 0]"
"I know I'm overreacting but I need to vent So there is this girl I've been friends with for three years. Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their ""you're my best friend"" and ""I love you, I care about you"" shit. The thing is I guess I'm pretty pissed off because I've always struggled to make friends but even when I have they don't give a shit. I'm so tired. Honestly, fuck everyone.",0,"Yes.

There are several signs of depression present in the post. Firstly, the poster expresses feelings of exhaustion and frustration with people, indicating a lack of enjoyment or interest in social interactions. They also mention struggling to make friends, which could be a sign of difficulty with socialization. Additionally, the poster expresses feelings of anger and irritation with their friend, which could indicate feelings of hopelessness or helplessness in their relationships. These negative emotions and attitudes are common symptoms of depression. Overall, the combination of negative emotions, social struggles, and feelings of hopelessness suggest that the poster may be experiencing depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 2, 2]","[0, 0, 0]","[2, 2, 0]"
"Went to a therapy centre for the first time today I hesitated so much before going, I almost went back too many times.

Anyway, I__e filled out the forms and I__ waiting to be contacted by the centre, it__ scary and weird.",1,"No. 

There is no evidence of depression in the post. The main emotions expressed are hesitation, nervousness, fear, and perhaps a bit of embarrassment at knocking on the wrong door. These emotions are understandable for someone who is new to therapy or seeking help for the first time. However, there are no specific mentions of low mood, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, or other symptoms commonly associated with depression. Therefore, it is unlikely that the poster is showing signs of depression based on this post alone.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[1, 2, 2]","[2, 2, 2]"
"help with friends/roommate situation I have been trying to be friends with my roommate for months, but recently noticed she uses me. I always invite her to hang out, I do all the cleaning, I bake her food, do sweet things, helped her when shes throwing up, taken care of her, and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others. She's never once said thank you or has reciprocated, and my mother and a friend called it into my attention. I was fine with it (sort of), but I really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends. But like I said, its fine you can't force people to care back. My problem arose when I introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road I was very familiar with and didn't want her to go through, and she proceeded to ""Steal"" my bestest friends. I only say the world steal because she doesn't try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group. I'm just so angry and can't talk to her, she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now, and has just kind of shoved me to a curb. I find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because I was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up, and she knew I was lonely and super super happy when I made my supposed close friends. She is so fake with them, it doesn't make sense. For example, one of my friends was going through a rough time and I was helping him get through it, and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once. Yes, reader you are probably thinking to yourself, what's wrong with wanting to help people? And I would agree with you, there isn't anything wrong. But the thing is that she lacks consistency. She only tries to help when it is beneficial to her. Helping people is not in her personality, I spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye. Why care about my friend who I had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with? She literally had met him like twice?! I think I forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she didn't have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex...sounds sketchy af to me.... Point is, I haven't talked to her in two weeks, I just can't hang with my friends anymore, and everyone thinks I'm the bad guy. I myself don't know if I am the bad guy, my close friends from home think I have a right to be upset..am I the bad guy for being upset? What should I even do at this point? Some people told me I needed to find better friends since they don't take my feelings into consideration, but I don't want to be that bitch that is like you have to choose friends...I'm conflicted with that because loyalty in friendship is very important..idk please help I'm just so sad and mad",0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

1. The poster mentions being ""lowkey depressed"" for medical reasons and a tough break up. 
2. They mention feeling lonely and upset for months on end. 
3. They state that they have been ""sobbing and upset"" for months. 
4. They express feeling sad and mad in their current situation.

I have great friends, amazing friends that were always there for me in the past, but I just don't feel any of that anymore. And yes, I know I should be considerate that they are people that have a life of their own with school and family and all their homework, but I feel in a way neglect. I asked them for once if they wanted to hang out, but they reply with ""sorry I'm busy with homework"" but then I see that they were making a costume and having a photoshoot with some other friend which would have took hours of work. I know I shouldn't say anything and I should be forunate that they still consider me their prized friend however, I feel neglected. I feel as if they don't even care or want to even care about me anymore because I'm the one always chatting in the chat, but I get short replies back once in the blue moon. It makes me feel like they just stopped because they found someone else. On top of that, they calmed they were sick and I do believe that. They actually had initially told me that they wanted to give me a present for Christmas which is rare because they never really give me things (once on a blue moon maybe) and I only give gifts to them for their birthday. But now since they are sick, I have a feeling I'm going to be told ""no, sorry I am sick and need to relax after finals"" when they always go out with their other friends for these occasions no matter what. I want to say this again, but I feel that it is not right that I am feeling disappointed and neglected because a person is allowed to do what they want. I am not not allowed to tell them what to do as they have their own life and I wouldn't like that.

My point of view I feel is too biased because I already know the person and their habits and I have an emotional response to this.",0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, the statement ""I don't know if I am allowed to feel this way"" indicates a sense of self-doubt and questioning of one's own emotions, which is common in depression. 

Secondly, the poster expresses feelings of ""neglect"" and being ""disappointed,"" which are symptoms of depression related to feelings of worthlessness and dissatisfaction with life. 

Thirdly, the poster mentions losing close friends and feeling like they do not care about them anymore, which could indicate a lack of social support and feelings of loneliness, also common in depression.

It's so much easier to fall back in than to fight against it,1,"As an AI language model, I cannot determine the emotion expressed explicitly in this post. However, I would say that the statement expresses a sense of defeat and resignation to a recurring pattern of behavior. The poster is acknowledging that giving in to temptation or negative behaviors is easier than trying to resist them. 

Based on this statement alone, it is difficult to say whether the poster is showing signs of depression or not. The statement could relate to any number of situations or emotions. However, it is possible that this statement could be a reflection of feelings of hopelessness or apathy that are common in depression. 

Therefore, my answer would be ""Maybe"" as the statement could be interpreted in various ways and since it is an isolated post without context, it cannot provide a full picture of the poster's emotional state.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[3, 3, 2]","[2, 2, 2]"
"My mom showed heavy favoritism to sister, and i deeply resent both of them. So, i'm 20. I__ a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i'd love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i'm overreacting? So, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that's kind of a given, right? But that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me. Here is when the bs started. . So, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled. So, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn't particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i've always had this ""thing"", where i have to run my fingers through someone's hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully. How? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn't sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she'd come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again. We later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom. Come to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked. I kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born. Sadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma. Now, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports. So, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn't do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a ""Participant"" ribbon, my big moment was ruined. I was gonna do it again next year, but when i wrote my speech, i had no enthusiasm for the project, and it lacked the ""zing"" the previous one had, so i didn't advance very far. I honestly didn't care anymore, mom asked about it, I told her my sister would probably ruin it. She started growing up, and became an even more entitled little tyrant. Here we start on her as a tween. She just got so much worse. First of all, mom really only paid attention to her. She never came in my room to come visit, at all. That's a general example, here is a more specific list. First of all, there was one time that my pants had a hole, the pocket ripped and my wallet fell out, and I never noticed until the next day. She found it, and instead of returning it, she took $100 out of it, then returned it the next day. Worst of all, she told mom to promise not to tell me that she took it, she bought a cell phone with it. I didn't even find out until almost 10 years later. Anytime I would try to spend time with mom, she'd always come in. I never got alone time with my mom, without her rearing her head. That was if I even got to spend time with her at all. She'd promise to spend time with me, but I__ either wait forever, and I__ be too tired to do anything. Or, she'd never show up at all. One time, it was about 8,",0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Reasoning: 

- The poster states that they ""instantly get depressed"" whenever they think back to their childhood, and that it has been haunting them for years. 
- They also mention that they cannot function when they feel this way. 
- Additionally, the poster expresses a deep resentment towards their mother and sister, which could be a sign of unresolved emotional pain or trauma. 
- These factors suggest that the poster is struggling with depression, as it is impacting their mood, daily functioning, and overall emotional well-being.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 2, 2]","[2, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"

I think what really hurts is it feels like my whole family is against me. After hearing what they said, I kind of hate them. I think I need to get away from this situation. But I have literally have no one else.",0,"Yes. 
The poster shows signs of depression because they express feeling hurt by their family's opinions of them, hating their family after hearing what they said, considering moving out, and feeling like they have no one else. These are all common symptoms of depression, such as low self-esteem, hopelessness, and isolation. The fact that they are doing most of their mother's chores also suggests a possible lack of motivation, which is another symptom of depression. Therefore, it is likely that the poster is experiencing some level of depression.","[3, 2, 3]","[3, 3, 2]","[1, 1, 1]","[2, 2, 1]"
"I dropped an internet friend several months ago and I regret it. I met her like almost 3 years ago. We were very close internet friends and would talk basically every day. She was amazing. In real life i had basically no friends. She was the only friend I had. I'm sure this led me to having unhealthy views on relationships. I still have unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships. Anyways, the trouble began when on instagram, our main chatting platform, she began to gain friends from just common interests and such. She started posting screenshots of her friends and her dm conversations and how funny they were. She then would post screenshots of her group chat conversations and how funny they were. All of this would happen, and I would still be waiting for a simple reply. I didn't get it. I still don't really get it. I was there for her for so long. She didn't have many friends in real life or online either. But once she had gotten these new internet friends she would ignore me? She would reply up to three or four days later. She also made a whole separate account where she would post as well which she never even told me about and I had to find out myself when she spoke about it on her main account. I finally had enough and sent her a long explanation about my feelings and stuff and didn't speak to her after that. And the funny thing is that she didn't reply to my explanation for two weeks. And suddenly she was like "":( nooo pls :(("" etc Typing all of this, I lowkey am getting annoyed.. I just want someone to smack some sense into me. Like it's been so long and I still think about her. It wasn't like she was a bad friend, but she just fuckin ignored me and basically left me. I usually think about her when I'm feeling lonely or my irl best friend starts to treat me like shit and ignores me.. but that's a different story... Right now, I'm thinking about dming her and just having small talk. I feel like it's a bad idea, but also it could reunite us and we could be friends again? It's probably a bad idea and I probably won't do it though.. Please give me words of wisdom.",0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

The poster mentions having unhealthy views on relationships and unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships. This could be a sign of depression affecting their ability to form and maintain healthy relationships. Additionally, the poster mentions feeling lonely and having no friends in real life, which is also a common symptom of depression. They also mention thinking about their internet friend when feeling lonely, which could indicate a possible dependency on that relationship for emotional support. Overall, the post reflects a sense of sadness, regret, and a desire for reconnection, which are all indicative of potential depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 3]","[2, 2, 2]","[2, 2, 2]"

Reasoning: 

1. The poster expresses feelings of betrayal and upset upon finding out about their son's marriage to a Mexican woman. 

2. They also state that they ""almost fainted"" upon seeing the wedding photos and that they feel ""utterly betrayed."" 

3. The poster also expresses disgust towards the idea of their son ""laying with a mud-skinned woman"" and not wanting anything to do with any potential mixed-race grandchildren. 

4. These strong negative emotions and beliefs about their son's relationship suggest a deeper underlying sadness and disappointment in their own perceived loss of control and expectations for their family's racial and cultural identity. 

5. These feelings can be indicative of depression, as the poster may be experiencing a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness in seeing their family's values and traditions seemingly challenged or changed.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 0]","[2, 2, 1]"

I feel confused, but I also got so turned on, what should I do?",0,"Yes. The poster expresses feelings of depression and shame in their post. They mention feeling confused and turned on after the altercation with their stepmother. This suggests that they are struggling with conflicting emotions and possibly experiencing guilt or self-blame. Additionally, the fact that they turned to masturbation in a sink instead of seeking out proper coping mechanisms or support indicates that they may be struggling with feelings of isolation or low self-worth. Overall, these factors suggest that the poster is experiencing depression.","[3, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[1, 1, 0]","[2, 1, 1]"
"""You can count on me"" That sweet lie. Maybe this post is a way to vent. Maybe I just need to feel like someone, somwhere has read this and, in a way, I've actually said it. I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have, I consider them quite close. One of them (let's cal him Joel) is by far the one whom i have a closest relationship with we are bouth 30 right now. I met him as the boyfriend of a workmate about 7 years ago and even after they broke up we stayed as friends. Joel has a tendency for depression, and I've always tried to help him in any way possible. Because of this problem he ended up hooked on Cocaine, he admited it to me, and we tried everything possible to solve it. So far he seems to be dealing with it reasonably well, but I've had some very rough nights in which i would recieve a text message, wake up at 4 am, grab my keys and drive to his home to literally hold him in my hands while he cried back to sleep and then sand the rest of the night outside his bedroom's door. Basically, When I say the words ""You can count on me for anything"" I really mean it, and I think I've proved that to him. Fast forward to last May and, for the first time in many, many years (before i even met him) I was hit with depression myself for various reasons. It hit me hard, suicide attempt hard. I tried to deal with it by myself, but finally turned to him and told him what was happening during what I consider the worst night so far in my life. The night I hugged my dog, left him at a friends house ""for a few days because i had to leave the city for work"" and drove to the forest with the intention of not comming back. In that forest I called Joel in tears, told him whats was happening to me (didnt tell him what i was planning) and he literally said ""I feel bad i can't go there, but I had promissed someone else I havent seen in a while to hang out tonight"" but told me I ""could count on him for whatever I needed"". To say I was shocked would be an understatement. Obviously I didnt end my life that day, but I could not believe what had happened. I tried to ignore it, called Joel the very next day and asked him to meet me whenever it was possible. This was in May. I would not see Joel's face until September 2nd after basically begging him to meet up. I'm writing this on November 26, and we have met once since then, a day I had to beg for again in which i planned to tell him how I was dealing with my problem. He invited a girlfriend he just met and a co-worker to said meeting. I find myself thinking about this every day, about how a person can be so selfish to have a friend, someone temselves call his best friend, in this situation and proceed to ignore it and basically run away. After all we have been through this situation is hurting me far more than the reasons that nearly drove me to suicide some months ago. I want to tell something to everyone who has taken the time to read this. **Never say ""You can count on me"" if you dont mean it,** you may think you do, but consider if you are actually up to the task. Because,** a failure in this regard can completely crush someone's spirit far more than any problem they needed help with in the first place.**",0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

- The poster mentions experiencing depression themselves and even attempting suicide. 
- They also describe feeling hurt by their friend's lack of support during this difficult time, which could be indicative of feelings of isolation and abandonment often associated with depression. 
- Additionally, the poster emphasizes the importance of not making promises of support if one cannot follow through, suggesting a personal understanding of how crucial reliable support can be in times of need. 

Taken together, these elements suggest that the poster has a personal experience with depression and may be struggling with it in the present.","[3, 2, 3]","[2, 2, 2]","[3, 1, 3]","[2, 1, 2]"
"Awful Friend Trying to Reunite Friend Group I have this friend, let's call him G, and he was a part of a friend group that I brought together. To make a long story short, he got bored, and (admittedly) lied about me to them, then when he found out they didn't like him as much as they liked each other, he ran back to me. I let him be my friend again, and he outed me as bi to my religious summer camp, which I then had to leave. He came back 3 months later saying he was going to therapy and he realized what he did wrong and was trying to get better, so we kept distant contact, but I found out last week he was still friends with the people he lied to (who are now gossiping about me and trying to convince my friends to end their friendships with me). I told him I was done being friends with him because he constantly endangers me or puts me in uncomfortable positions, and he called me crying about how he just wishes things were ""like they were in freshman year"" and that he ""should have never lied to them"". I hung up. He messaged me this morning asking me to meet up with our old friend group over spring break. I don't know what to do.

The poster shows signs of depression through their language and behavior. They express feeling hurt by their friend's actions and seem to feel isolated from their friend group. They mention leaving a summer camp due to being outed as bi, which can indicate feelings of shame or embarrassment. Additionally, they mention feeling scared and unsure about reconnecting with their old friend group, which suggests anxiety. The poster's decision to cut ties with their friend and avoid contact with the group could also be a sign of depression, as isolation and withdrawal from social activities are common symptoms.

"Brother rage attack my grandmother My brother is prone to rage attacks. Him and I had that classic ""brother love"" growing up. Anyways this isn't about me it's about my grandmother. So my grandma from my mom's side came from out of the country to live with us for a couple months (my brother and I still live with our mom). To help with housework and see our family. She is the one of the sweetest ladies out there. Typical caring loving person, very sensitive and full of love &amp; happiness. Now my brother comes into the equation... he's had his rage bursts with me and I've learned to deal with it as well as my mother. They say how you treat your mom is how you treat your wife. Honestly, he's so disrespectful to my mom at times it makes me vehement. What can I do come in and save the day (when I have done in the past it only made things worse). Anyways, I thought I knew my brother well and knew he wouldn't dare yell at my grandma. OMG boy was I wrong he crossed that line. A rage attack came at my grandma with yelling and this time I did intervene. After things settled I consoled my grandma she was shocked, sad, unable to believe he was like this. So I told her the truth he has always been like this and I feel just as much pain as she felt becuase seeing her distraught was one of the most depressing things I have ever witnessed. She wants to leave and go back although I can tell she is worried for me &amp; my mom. Hate to break the news baba but ya he's a fucking entitled narcisstic pieces of shit on the planet. I understand when guys blow steam with other guys but seriously to your own mother and grandmother. I think it's completely unacceptable and disrespectful.

The poster expresses multiple emotions throughout the post, including sadness, shock, and depression. They describe the incident with their brother and grandmother as ""one of the most depressing things I have ever witnessed."" Additionally, they mention feeling just as much pain as their grandmother, which could indicate a personal experience with depression.

"Shoudl I just stop being friends with this guy? I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it__ hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying __ou got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy._ This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called __est friend._ He randomly went up to a girl I didn__ know and told her I liked her, she then said __ don__ care._ I don__ know if this was a rejection or just a simple __ don__ care_ but I didn__ really care because I didn__ find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word __igga._ Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i__ half black and she says __ know._ This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it__ one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn__ even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl__ tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn__ really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, __ou__e gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That__ why you got dumped by an ugly bitch._ And he walked away, as i__ walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn__ insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It__ actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i__ have much better friends. What do I do, it__ one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this __riend_ if mine?",0,"Yes. The poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, the post opens with the poster questioning whether they should stop being friends with someone, which indicates a feeling of social isolation or disconnection. Throughout the rest of the post, the poster describes a series of negative experiences with this friend, including being made fun of, physically abused, and publicly humiliated. These experiences likely contribute to the feeling of being alone and unsupported that is often associated with depression. 

Additionally, the tone of the post is generally negative and self-deprecating. The poster describes themselves as ""mean"" and ""annoying,"" and expresses regret that they did not have better friends to begin with. They also mention feeling embarrassed and ashamed after using a racial slur in public, which could be indicative of anxiety or low self-esteem. 

Overall, while the post does not explicitly mention depression, the emotions and experiences it describes align with common symptoms of the disorder, such as feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and isolation.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[2, 1, 2]"

She started to ignore,even get mad me me as to why I don't text it first..well,why does it matter so much who texts first? Seems like a childish thinking in my opinion.I told her that I can't be the only person that talks in this friendship,so she told me she'll text me first.She never did,but I saw it coming anyway. I realized that for her, it did not matter whether I am next to her or not.She is so apathetic,almost to the point where it hurted me.But I decided to let go,focus more on myself,study more,read more,invest in my own hobbies and so on,so forth.As I was doing these,I started learning more things about myself,discovering things I didn't know about until now.And all of these happened,because I decided to leave her.She noticed this behaviour of mine and actually started talking to me,but it wouldn't matter anyway because it was an endless cycle.All she sees now is her boyfriend,I think the only reason she goes to school is just to see him,nothing else. As I look back at our past [which is,kind of,sorta tragic and I don't want to into detail],I realized that I was the only one who truly cared.I always cried for her,I wonder if she cried for me,at least once?She blocked on me on our social medias for the stupidest reasons [She thought I was annoyed because she was talking too much about her boyfriend] and somehow I was but I didn't want to show it..but what did she accomplish by blocking me for almost a month,anyway?

The language used in the post is indicative of negative emotions, such as feeling hurt, apathetic, and fed up. The poster repeatedly mentions crying and worrying in the middle of the night, which are typical symptoms of depression.

"I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited I'm unsure how to feel. I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California. My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class. I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently. I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation. Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid. I am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren't even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I'm paying for myself!). My mom said she's busy with work and has to coordinate a lot. She always says ""maybe next summer we'll make a trip out there!"" I'm the first person in my family to graduate college and it's kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own. I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday. I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me. It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him. I was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not. I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it. They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live. It's been six years! My mom just bought a house so I know she's at least had some money for a $300 plane ticket. What should I do? Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine? Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me? Should I beg them to come to my graduation/party (I've already asked several times). I feel so awkward making up excuses for them all the time (my friends often ask when my family is coming to visit). Thanks!",0,"Yes. 

The poster expresses a sense of sadness and feeling unimportant to their family. They feel that their achievements have gone unnoticed and uncelebrated by their family, and even after six years, their parents have shown little interest in visiting or staying in touch. The poster also mentions questioning whether to visit home and pretending everything is fine, indicating a sense of reluctance to face the situation or emotional discomfort. These are all signs of depression, indicating a lack of motivation and lacking interest in things that were previously important to them.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[2, 1, 1]"
"Never rely on anyone, for even your own shadow leaves you when you are in darkness. Meaning?

However, this does not necessarily indicate depression, as these feelings can be a normal response to past negative experiences or a coping mechanism for protecting oneself from future harm. 

Therefore, the answer is No, the poster does not show any signs of depression. While it is possible that they may be struggling with depressive symptoms, this post alone is not conclusive evidence of such. It is important to avoid making assumptions about someone's mental health based on a single observation, and instead seek out further context or communication to better understand their situation.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[1, 0, 1]","[2, 0, 2]"

This is selfish, and assumes love only runs one way, as if sons and daughters cannot have a strong love for their parents. Shouldn't we be angry at our parents for only being concerned with their own suffering?",0,"Yes.

The post expresses a deep sense of anger towards the poster's parents for not considering the emotional toll their eventual deaths would have on their children. The language used is strong and intense, and the poster seems to be struggling with feelings of resentment and betrayal. These are all common symptoms of depression, as individuals who are depressed often experience intense feelings of anger and frustration, especially towards those they feel have wronged them. Additionally, the tone of the post suggests a lack of hope or optimism, which is another common symptom of depression. Overall, while it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis based on one post, the strong emotional reaction and negative outlook expressed by the poster suggest that they may be experiencing depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 2, 3]","[1, 1, 2]","[2, 1, 2]"

The poster describes experiencing significant distress and negative emotions, including loss of appetite, loss of sleep, and crying endlessly for over a week. These symptoms are common indicators of depression, and the poster also mentions seeking support from a psychologist. Therefore, it is likely that the poster is experiencing depression in response to the situation with their friend.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 3]","[3, 1, 3]","[2, 2, 3]"
"I [22/m] and a friend of mine [20/m] had a dispute which questions our friendship. TL;DR, OP misread the situation by telling a joke to which his drunk friend took offence and revealed to OP's other friends OPs 3-year buried drug habit. OPs friends now know things OP originally wanted to be left in the past. ********* My friend (let's call him T, for now) and I had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other. T was very drunk and gave some information I kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time. He mentioned the last time I got high, but he did mention how long ago. This is important because Ive had an on and off history of depression which I've been struggling with years, and I previously I used to combat it by developing a drug habit. I've been working hard to be clean for 3 years, and I've kept all this under the rug because I didn't wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible, or be denied respect as their friend. I buried my past and drug habits for good, doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing I felt I like I myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time. He did all this because I had made a joke in this particular conversation, to which he reacted negatively, and said I ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so. Because of this, people I trust now are asking me if I do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me. Some people I'm friends with are asking me if I need counselling though I'm clean. I'm not sure if I can forgive him and it's made me feel less than a person, which is something I haven't felt in 3 years. I feel worthless again and I'm not quite sure I can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life. Should I cut ties with T? What should I do if now my other friends might not see me the same way anymore?",0,"Yes.

The poster mentions having a history of depression that they have been struggling with for years. They also mention developing a drug habit as a way to combat it, and that being clean for three years brought them great happiness and helped them come out of depression. However, the situation with their friend T has now made them feel less than a person and worthless again, which suggests that they may be experiencing a relapse of their depression. The fact that they are worried about how their other friends might now perceive them and whether they can mend those relationships also suggests a level of anxiety and low self-esteem, which are common symptoms of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 2]","[3, 1, 3]","[2, 1, 2]"

Reasoning: While the post does express a sense of loneliness and fear, it does not necessarily indicate depression. It is a common fear or concern for many individuals, and the poster simply relates to the sentiment expressed in the quote. There are no other clear signs of depression in the post, such as a lack of enjoyment in life, feelings of hopelessness, or a negative outlook on the future.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 3]","[1, 0, 1]","[2, 0, 2]"
"Try to stop identifying with your thoughts Dude, I know how it is to be depressed. I know how it is to be sick and tired of being sick and tired. Tired of the hate, tired of being tired of the hate, tired of being tried of being affected by the hate. But what has worked for me and helped me rarely have SA or A these days was focusing on my breath when a thought comes. Im 1 year and some months in since i started to liberate myself.

What do you got to lose? Check out Eckhart Tolle or Noah Elkrief on youtube.",1,"No.

Reasoning: 
Although the poster acknowledges that they have experienced depression in the past, they express a sense of hope and offer advice on how they have personally dealt with their struggles. They also mention feeling peace and pleasure, which suggests that they have been able to find some relief from their depression. Therefore, there are no signs of depression present in the post.","[3, 3, 3]","[0, 1, 1]","[1, 0, 1]","[2, 0, 2]"

Firstly, they express feelings of disgust and rage towards their mother, indicating a lack of enjoyment or pleasure in their relationships. They also mention experiencing bullying at school, which could contribute to feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem. 

Secondly, the poster notes that their mother refuses to allow them to see a therapist and reacts negatively when they try to seek help, potentially exacerbating any mental health issues they may be experiencing. 

Finally, the poster mentions being underweight and not having family support, which could contribute to feelings of hopelessness or apathy. 

Taken together, these factors suggest that the poster is struggling with their mental health and may be experiencing symptoms of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 2, 2]","[3, 1, 1]","[2, 1, 2]"
"Dealing with a spiteful sister-in-law? I'm 28, and we are all living under the same roof. I live with my mom and dad, and help take care of my grandparents.. I have fibromyalgia, chronic pain, migraines 4-5 times a week and have trouble getting out of bed some days. Brother (loses jobs frequently, can never keep his wife happy) she's become a very spiteful and distant person in the last 2 years. They decided to move in March of 2016 after not getting their way of getting help from my mom (who helps everyone and is the kindest and most selfless person you will ever meet). They have 3 kids, and now a fourth one on the way in May. Brother ""Dave"" and his wife gonna call her ""Vick"". Always go back and forth at one another, as he loses jobs and they both work (she's held a stable job and he hasn't), calls him lazy, P.O.S., a horrible father, our family made her the way she is now, tells her kids to ""suck it or, or stop crying"" when they get upset or hurt. She used to be the sweetest, kindest person ever. I REALLY liked this woman, and we got along great. I could never say a bad thing about her 10 years ago. Until, I came out in 2008 as gay. She was supportive or so I thought. Then wrote a long nasty letter to me after telling my mom she didn't want me holding my boyfriends hand around her kids, that she didn't want that exposed to them, etc. I called her a hypocrite and walked off, because she did all these things with her husband and more. Nothing more, nothing less. Cause she was and I was sick of all her bull about me and her hating on the way I was. I don't say things unless something truly bothers me and I was at the last straw. Said she didn't support me being gay, me being with my boyfriend was wrong, she doesn't want her kids around it, etc. Anyway, little bits of this kept coming up over the last 9 years and slowly grew distant from her. Last one me being worried about her being mad at me for something, as she came in and didn't talk to me or respond to what I had said. I said is she mad at me? To my brother. He goes I don't think so. She then yells ""I'm not mad, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC!"" I'm like wow.. completely out of character for her. I've never done anything to her to get spoken to like this. 1 year ago -- she called my brother a piece of sh*t for the 40th time. I got tired of it, her belittling him, throwing his things, telling him that our family are horrible people for the fights we get in once every 2 months. He looked defeated, he looked the saddest I've ever seen him. I asked what was wrong, he told me. I agreed with what he had said about her letting the children use the tablets too, that it was ridiculous that she's called him something so horrible over it. I was really angry at her, disappointed with her. We had gotten into a big fight after me coming out before as well and she denied everything that happened that day. I whipped out my phone for this one -- so all the facts were here. Everything was caught on camera for the minute we got into it. After I go into my room, she comes and slams the door next to my room closed and says, ""You've got to me f'ing kidding me. Is he really siding with you. HELL NO!"" to my brother. I come out and say what's the problem? (My mistake, but no... no one in my family has ever said anything to this woman to keep the peace. They're afraid of her taking the grandchildren away and my mom loves them dearly and is afraid of having a bad relationship with her.) I say ""I'm tired of you calling my brother a piece of crap."" I yelled, ""Stop treating him like that, what the hell is wrong with you? Who says that to the person they love and are married to? Why do you belittle him so much when he's finally got a nice job. I can't believe anyone in this house doesn't say anything to you over the way you treat him, specially around your kids. You say we're saying bad words in front of them and you guys and making you this way, analyze yourself."" She tells then to ""go back to your room, get a frigging job."" Then turns to my brother and says ""do something with your brother, go back to your room!""""I say no, you don't like what I have to say (and I speak for everyone in this house cause it's true). You can go."" This sparks her sister to message me -- telling me ""Never in my life have I been so disgusted with someone. Who do you think you are filming her!? The mother of your nephew and nieces raising your voice at her telling her to get out. I'm so disgusted, get the F' outta here!"" Brother wouldn't defend her after that happened. She went to my mom (who's like best friends with her) -- she didn't defend her. She then split with him for 8 months (this last August) that day. Now they're back together. Saying they're going to move and haven't. Ever since then, she's just been passive aggressive. Stands in the doorway and doesn't move when I need to get through. Is constantly rude when anyone says anything to her kids (when they're making a mess, yelling and telling adults to stop talking to them) unattended downstairs as she's on the couch upstairs.

The poster mentions having fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and migraines 4-5 times a week, which can all be associated with depression. They also describe feeling uncomfortable and distant from their sister-in-law, which can be a sign of social withdrawal and isolation, both commonly seen in depression. Additionally, the poster expresses frustration and disappointment with the situation but doesn't seem to have much hope for improvement, another hallmark of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 1, 2]","[1, 0, 1]","[2, 0, 2]"
I don't care about my stepchild. Okay. So I've been married for about 9 months or so. My wife had a kid from someone previously before me. He is two and a half now. I've never cared about him and don't give a shit about him. I know it's not right to say but it's how I feel. I've put up with it the past 2 years because I knew it was the right thing to do for her. We want to have a baby. I want to have a child now of my own but I'm afraid that I will never care for him whatsoever and will care and love my child and never care or love him. I don't know what to do anymore. Me and my wife have never had problems in our relationship or even an arguement. It's not her or us it's me personally. I hate the feeling of not caring. I'm trying to find a solution that doesn't end up with me leaving. But what do you do when you don't care about your step child? I need a solution to this fucked it problem. I care about her. Just Not about him.,0,"Yes, the poster shows signs of depression. 

Step 1: The poster expresses a lack of emotion towards their stepchild and admits to not caring about them, which can be a symptom of depression. 

Step 2: The poster also mentions feeling stuck and unsure of what to do, which can be a sign of feeling helpless or overwhelmed, common experiences in depression. 

Step 3: The poster describes feeling like they ""hate the feeling of not caring,"" suggesting they may be struggling with feelings of guilt or shame related to their lack of emotional attachment. 

Taken together, these factors suggest that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression that are impacting their ability to form emotional connections with others.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 1, 2]","[0, 0, 0]","[2, 0, 1]"
"Close friend suddenly turned cold I have a friend who's had some mental and anxiety issues in the past. We generally chat online, although we've met up in real life a number of times, and talk on the phone sporadically. They have an issue with trust. They believe no one cares about them and that every friend they have will eventually leave them. So fairly insecure. They are currently attending therapy (have for a number of months) to help them with their anxiety. They are meditating etc. At a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their life_ユ_o as far as I know, it's not a lie. Anyway, I stepped up because I thought this person was pretty special and intelligent. I loved that they were passionate and outspoken and unique. Over time, I developed some feelings for them too but more a great love as a friend than anything too romantic. Anyhow, we grew close. We shared many things, pretty much every day, although I believe she feared that she was abusing the friendship because I would try and reassure her a lot. She asked for my advice, and I gave it without thought. When she was upset, I tried my best to calm her down and express care. When she needed a boost, I gave it to her. She was worth my time. And she did the same for me. Because she was going through a hard time in general, I did all this because she was who she was. Then...we had a couple of fights. Nothing horrible, and we supposedly worked through our problems but...I've been having my own issues recently. After the last fight, where we talked everything out on the phone and she expressed the qualities she liked about me, as a friend, and how she was afraid that doing so in the past had pushed people away...well. Now, she's cold and distant. Not 100%, but there's something sincerely off, enough to notice. Phrasing that you wouldn_ユ_ use with a friend, let alone an acquaintance. I have years and years of examples to the contrary and I_ユ_e asked a therapist friend to have a look at the differences as well. She_ユ_ definitely changed; it's definitely not just me. Supposedly, she_ユ_ looking after her mental health. I can see how having a person there to always reassure them may lead to this person not being as eager or able to rely on themselves, but we could have worked this out. I would have supported them through it. My support was enough up until three weeks ago when something quite major occurred and upset them. Now, I get _ユell, I suppose that_ユ_ very kind of you_?when I express concern for how she is and _ユガow do I know that you_ユ_e not rolling your eyes?_?when I express that I care and _ユhat possible use could I be to you_?when I tried to give her a little advice and express that she's important to me too.

She also stated that she was going to be a better friend. Now I hear _ユキ need balance in my life_? as if it was a major issue to be close to someone. The two things_ユ_etter mental health/developing more of an ability to take care of oneself *and* having someone close to confide in_ユ_re not mutually exclusive.

Firstly, the poster mentions that they have been having their own issues recently, which could suggest a decline in their mental health. Additionally, they state that they have lost sleep over the situation and are hurting, which are common symptoms of depression. 

Furthermore, the poster mentions that they feel like they have lost a large part of their support network, which could contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation, also common symptoms of depression.

"I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments.

1. The poster mentions feeling constantly afraid of rejection and disapproval from others, indicating low self-esteem and negative thought patterns.
2. The poster also states that they feel like they are not wanted and that something is going wrong every time, indicating feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.
3. The poster mentions feeling reluctant to take initiative and lacking energy, which are common symptoms of depression.
4. The use of the word ""sigh"" at the end of the post also suggests a sense of defeat and resignation, which can be associated with depression.

Why girls do that? Why girls can make you feel like a shit and why do you need to cry so hard and much after them?,1,"No, the poster does not show any signs of depression. 

Reasoning: 
The post expresses frustration and emotional distress related to a past romantic relationship or experience with girls. The language used portrays a mix of anger, confusion and disappointment, but it does not suggest a persistent feeling of sadness or hopelessness, which are common indicators of depression. Furthermore, the post does not offer any clues about changes in the poster's mood, self-esteem, or interest in daily activities, which are also relevant in assessing depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the content of the post alone, there is no evidence to suggest that the poster is experiencing depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[1, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
Would you remain friends with an old friend who you planned to rob? So would you plan on still being friends with that person after you planned to rob their house because you yourself need money urgently. Would you remain friends?,0,"Yes.

The post seems to express some form of desperation and moral conflict, as the poster is contemplating robbing a friend's house out of desperation for money. This suggests that the poster might be going through a difficult time financially or emotionally, which could lead to feelings of depression. Additionally, the fact that the poster is considering betraying a friend for personal gain also suggests a lack of healthy relationship boundaries and potentially low self-worth, which are common symptoms of depression. Overall, while the post does not overtly express feelings of sadness or hopelessness, it does suggest that the poster is experiencing some level of emotional turmoil and may be struggling with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 0]","[0, 0, 0]","[1, 0, 0]"

Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live? When I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing. I was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christ_ユ_ sake.

The poster expresses feeling mentally exhausted, powerless, and anxious for six to seven years. These are common symptoms of depression. Additionally, the constant uncertainty and lack of stability caused by the indecisiveness of their parents can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, which are also indicators of depression. Overall, the emotional tone of the post suggests that the poster may be struggling with depression as a result of their situation.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[1, 0, 1]","[1, 0, 1]"

Reasoning: The poster explicitly states that they ""feel really really really great"" and are genuinely happy for the first time in over 9 months. They attribute this positive change to a conversation with their best friend, suggesting that they have found a source of support and positivity in their life. While they mention dependence on others, this is not necessarily indicative of depression in and of itself, as many people rely on close relationships for emotional support. Overall, the tone of the post is one of excitement and joy, with no indications of the feelings of sadness, hopelessness or apathy that are commonly associated with depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]","[2, 3, 3]"
"How do I keep from being jealous of my very successful best friend? So, I've been die-hard friends with this girl for about 4 years. Our friendship has been through SO MUCH during that time: the death of her father, relationships and breakups, we've worked several jobs together and lived together. We jokingly call each other ""husband and wife""! She's an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She's getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house. I am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth. Recently, I've had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was ""cheating on me"". I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day.

The poster expresses feelings of jealousy towards their friend's success and freedom while they themselves feel ""chained to a desk job"". This comparison may cause negative thoughts and feelings to arise, which can contribute to depression. Additionally, the poster mentions having bad dreams about their friend, which could be a sign of underlying psychological distress. It is important for the poster to address these feelings and seek support if necessary.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 1]","[1, 0, 1]","[2, 1, 1]"
"Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job. So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"". Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around. So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point. Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to do. It's just tonight seemed to be the worst. So she calls me up and tells me that her boyfriend is off of work so she won't need a ride and she thought that we could all hangout. Since we were going to meet up with some more friends. Welp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I'm pretty sure she agreed(it's honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn't seem interested at all about being there. So we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I'm just sitting there thinking ""she wants us or one of us to go",0,"Yes. The poster shows signs of depression. 

Firstly, the tone of the post is very negative and pessimistic. The poster seems very unhappy in their friendship with this person and is annoyed and frustrated by their behavior. This is demonstrated by the use of phrases like ""disrespectful phone etiquette,"" ""most ideal job I could think of but she brags,"" and ""I wonder if she likes hurting me."" 

Secondly, the poster expresses feelings of bitterness and jealousy towards their friend's job and success, indicating feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. 

Finally, the poster mentions that they have a tendency to cut people out of their life, which could suggest a broader pattern of isolation and detachment from others, another symptom of depression.","[3, 3, 3]","[1, 1, 3]","[1, 1, 0]","[1, 1, 1]"
"Are any of you on agomelatine? Currently on 30mg/mirtazapine a day, which is ok aside from how hungry and sleepy it makes me (I understand that they can be desirable effects for some people but not what I_ユ_ looking for). I read a bit about agomelatine and it appears not to have those side effects but I wanted to know how real people have experienced it before asking the doctor to prescribe it. Thanks",1,"No. 

Reasoning: Although the poster discusses their current medication and potential side effects, they do not specifically mention feeling or experiencing symptoms of depression. Additionally, they seem to be actively seeking ways to improve their current medication regimen, which suggests a proactive approach to managing their mental health.","[3, 3, 3]","[2, 0, 0]","[2, 2, 0]","[2, 2, 0]"
