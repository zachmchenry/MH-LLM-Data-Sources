"Consider this post: ""Its like that, if you want or not.“ ME: I have no problem, if it takes longer. But you asked my friend for help and let him wait for one hour and then you haven’t prepared anything. Thats not what you asked for. Instead of 3 hours, he helped you for 10 hours till 5am..."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses frustration and perhaps a sense of injustice regarding the treatment of their friend, it's not explicitly clear if the poster themselves is experiencing stress. They seem more concerned with the unfairness of the situation."
"Consider this post: ""I man the front desk and my title is HR Customer Service Representative. About 50% of my job is spent onboarding new hires. Maybe 10% is clerical/paperwork. The rest is dealing with people who walk in and need help with benefits, retirement, etc. Although I am required to know the basics of our benefits plans and how the retirement and pension benefits work, many employees have questions beyond my knowledge base."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Given the nature of the poster's job description and the fact that they often encounter questions beyond their expertise, it is likely that the poster experiences stress. Handling a steady flow of inquiries and potentially not always having the answers can create feelings of inadequacy or pressure to provide the best service, both of which can contribute to stress."
"Consider this post: ""We'd be saving so much money with this new housr...its such an expensive city.... I did some googling in their language and found that it was illegal for them to do that. I was excited like oh ok if it happens ill call the police on them....  but now i did some further googling and turns out that if you sign the contract with that in it than everything is on their side... The contract is long term so we'd have to give 6months notice before leaving even if we give it next week ill still have to live six months with this.... i wanna die i swear i havent been so helpless and scared in so long.... Also two days ago my friend mentioned he ran into my ex who ruined my life and that he told him he wants to see mw and get closure."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: Given the combination of concerns over the housing situation and the emotional implications of hearing about their ex, it is likely that the poster is experiencing stress. The feeling of helplessness, fear, and the added tension from the past relationship indicates a heightened level of emotional strain."
"Consider this post: ""My ex used to shoot back with ""Do you want me to go with you?"" all the time, no matter what it was. I almost wonder if I blocked out him asking me that about our own wedding. I unloaded a terrible memory of this on my current BF today and he took it like a champ, I just could not stop chasing myself in circles over this and knew if I heard any sort of similar phrase I would lose it. I just needed to throw this out in the open, where others who might understand could 'hear' it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster shares an emotionally charged memory about their ex-partner who would frequently respond with the phrase ""Do you want me to go with you?"" regardless of the context. The poster recalls this memory with evident negative emotions and also mentions having shared it with their current boyfriend. The phrase seems to have triggered a strong reaction in the poster, indicating that it might be a sensitive topic for them. They expressed a need to share this with a community where others might understand and validate their feelings. Given the emotional weight the poster associates with this memory and the reaction they had even at the mention of a similar phrase, it is probable that the poster is experiencing stress related to past experiences and emotional triggers. The need to share and be understood suggests a seeking of support and validation in coping with these feelings."
"Consider this post: ""I haven’t said anything to him yet because I’m not sure how someone would take hearing that their partner has such fluctuations of feelings towards them (especially since he told me he loves me and is somewhat clingy). Nonetheless, I know a conversation will need to be had but I want to get my feelings in order first. What would y’all recommend, Reddit? TL;DR I have “hot and warm” feelings towards my boyfriend. Can’t figure out why."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster seems to be experiencing internal conflict and uncertainty regarding their feelings towards their boyfriend, which could be sources of stress. Their hesitation in communicating these feelings, especially given their boyfriend's expressed sentiments, also suggests a fear of potential conflict or hurting their partner, adding to the potential stress."
"Consider this post: ""Thanks. Edit 1 - Fuel Receipt As Requested. <url> Sorry for the long responses, I went to spend the night at a friends because it got really cold here! The Police said they don't give out a copy of the report but they gave me an incident number that can be used to verify the report was filed."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster had to deal with a situation that required police intervention, as indicated by the mention of a police report. Additionally, they mentioned having to spend the night at a friend's due to cold conditions. Both these situations suggest unexpected or unplanned events, which could be sources of stress. While the poster maintains a composed tone in the message, the situations described are typically associated with stress or discomfort."
"Consider this post: ""When moving into their tiny house, they would be given a state I.D. with that tiny house's address on it as well as a list of strict rules they have to follow lest they lose some privileges or even be evicted from their house depending on the rules broken. So basically they won't be homeless anymore but ""homed"" which is why the place would be called ""Homed"". Anyway, the homed will have to pay rent for their tiny homes by either getting a job (which is why it is important for them to get a state I.D.) or doing volunteer work around the community (e.g."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post's wording doesn't suggest significant emotional upheaval. The author is outlining a potential housing solution and delving into its regulations and prerequisites. There's no hint of the poster's personal stress or emotional struggle. Instead, the content leans more towards sharing information about a proposed scenario rather than conveying personal feelings."
"Consider this post: ""More specifically, for example, I live with roommates and I can't remember the last time it has been quiet in the apartment. There's never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it's anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn't handle listening to her loud voice any longer."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post conveys feelings of frustration and agitation due to consistent noise from roommates and the professor's manner of teaching. The language suggests sensory overload, difficulty sleeping, and challenges in managing emotions. The mention of feeling like ""storming out"" indicates a heightened emotional response, all of which point to the poster experiencing stress."
"Consider this post: ""Long story short my family in NE Ohio is abusive as hell so I had to leave the state and stay with family down south. It isn't working out and they're sending me packing to Ohio because I guess I'm a financial problem even though I got a job here. I have nowhere I can stay. I'm even getting rid of my beloved cat so I can have options. I can't go back to my family in Ohio."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post conveys a series of traumatic and challenging experiences: facing abusive family members, needing to relocate, not having stable accommodation, facing financial challenges, and having to part with a beloved pet. The overall tone of the post is one of desperation and distress, suggesting that the poster is experiencing significant emotional and situational stress."
"Consider this post: ""PTSD is life changing for the worse. Every day fight. Getting in a fist fight in high school( who did not get into a fight)  I'm not talking about bullying,  Playing video games,  having bad dreams does not cause PTSD. We have seen things, or done things or ,been part of things,  that most people will never understand and hopefully never experience. End of Rant"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post directly references PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), which is a mental health condition caused by experiencing or witnessing traumatic events. The poster seems to be drawing from personal experiences and expressing frustration about misconceptions regarding what triggers PTSD. The intense emotions conveyed and the mention of witnessing or being part of traumatic events suggest that the poster has personally experienced trauma and its aftermath, leading to stress."
"Consider this post: ""He’s abused my dog in the past and I’ve no doubt he’ll do it again. My dog is one of the only positive aspects in my life, so taking her to the humane society is something I really want to avoid. In addition to that I have no job, a partial college education (I’d prefer to stop going to school and get a job), and no place to go if I were to leave my husband. Please please tell me what I can do. I feel so hopeless about everything."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The post contains multiple stressors, including fear for the well-being of the dog due to past abuse, concern about potential future abuse by the husband, financial insecurity due to lack of a job, an unfinished college education, and feeling trapped in the current situation with no apparent escape. The direct statement ""I feel so hopeless about everything"" reinforces the notion of emotional distress and a sense of being overwhelmed."
"Consider this post: ""the only thing I ever want is just to be in his arms. Basically, terrifies me back into his arms every fucking time. We'll say I love you, he'll hold me so tight. He's so warm, I'm craving soo bad to be in his arms rn tbh. I don't wanna go to sleep knowing hes not going to be in bed with me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language of the post indicates a strong emotional dependence on another individual. Phrases such as ""terrifies me back into his arms every fucking time"" and ""I don't wanna go to sleep knowing hes not going to be in bed with me"" suggest an anxiety related to the absence of this individual and a potential fear of being alone. The intense yearning and emotional reliance indicated in the post can be associated with feelings of stress, especially when the individual is not present."
"Consider this post: ""Despite being younger than him, I have had more experiences with love and sex. He has always been curious about my past and even when I refuse telling him, he always asks me about my experiences with my exes or people who I have slept with. That's okay, I am a curious person too. He's older than me but I'm the first guy he had ever dated and I even took his virginity. The thing is, I know he feels jealous(?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The writer describes a scenario where their partner frequently inquires about their previous relationships, which could possibly stem from jealousy. The tone of the post is measured and factual, implying that while there might be some discomfort, it doesn't seem to be causing severe emotional turmoil for the poster."
"Consider this post: ""I go from living happily, almost as if that part of my life didn't happen, to being floored by pain. I feel guilty to myself for how strong the reactions are so many years later. I feel guilty to my partner who has to deal with it even though he's not the one who caused me this hurt. He's been nothing short of wonderful, but I'm scared my past will end up driving him away. I certainly wish I could get away from me sometimes."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions fluctuating emotional states, experiencing intense pain linked to past events, feelings of guilt, and concerns about how their past might affect their relationship. The language suggests an ongoing internal struggle, and the statement ""I certainly wish I could get away from me sometimes"" highlights a significant level of distress."
"Consider this post: ""If I go to an interview for example, I'll know that I'm a good candidate, I'll know that if I don't get it there will always be other opportunities and it's no big deal. Yet I still get nervous because it's something that I want, I want that employer to like me. If I go to an interview with no expectations at all, not even wanting the job (I've done this a few times for practice interviewing), it'll turn out great. What are your thoughts on this? Edit: FYI I'm talking mostly about social anxiety, though it has happened that I get anxiety in the most random places like just going upstairs in a building."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes experiencing nervousness and anxiety in various situations, such as during interviews and even in seemingly random scenarios. The mention of ""social anxiety"" and the example of getting anxious in unexpected places indicate that the individual experiences heightened levels of stress in social or unfamiliar situations. The reflection on their reactions in different scenarios suggests an ongoing internal effort to understand and cope with these feelings."
"Consider this post: ""Like sleep would never be a simple thing for me. So recently, I accidentally fell asleep at 8pm and I found myself awake around 4am. I immediately felt like I had screwed myself. My instinct was to try to go back to sleep but I decided, for whatever reason, not to. What I discovered was amazing."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The opening line suggests a struggle with sleep, implying that rest isn't straightforward for the individual. Feeling that they ""screwed"" themselves upon waking up at an unusual hour and the immediate instinct to correct the situation suggests that there's an ongoing concern or stress surrounding sleep patterns for this person. Even though they experienced a positive discovery at the end, the initial sentiments indicate an underlying stress about sleep."
"Consider this post: ""Discovering LimeWire was like breathing in fresh mountain air in the early hours of the morning while there is dew glazed over the leaves on the trees and surrounding grass. I felt a real connection with Post Hardcore/ Alternative. During this time I knew of Anxiety, but I didn't know OF it. In other words, I considered it a personality trait and not something treatable, more or less just apart of me. Playing video games secluded in my room and swimming on a variety of swim teams kept me sane to an extent but I was living in an isolated bubble."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions feeling a connection with genres like Post Hardcore/Alternative, which often tackle emotional and sometimes distressing topics. They also reference knowing of ""Anxiety"" and previously perceiving it as just a part of their personality rather than something treatable. This suggests they may have had unrecognized or untreated anxiety. The closing lines, where they talk about seclusion, playing video games, and swimming to ""keep sane,"" also hint at coping mechanisms to deal with underlying stress or emotional challenges."
"Consider this post: ""Manageable enough to come home on weekends and work at the job I loved, while driving back to school Sunday nights for the upcoming school week. I was confident in myself that I would be able to balance my newly found work-school life. The apartment I signed a year lease on, which ironically ends this month, was about a 10-minute drive from the campus itself. Not having any help from my parents, and having some money saved prior to going back to school, I thought it would have been enough. I ended up also getting an on-campus student job in the same line of work I am pursuing, and at the time majoring in at that University."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post conveys a largely upbeat and hopeful attitude. The writer discusses their capability in juggling both work and studies, having self-confidence, and the foresight of saving money before returning to school. Though they mention certain hurdles like not receiving parental support and the need to maintain equilibrium between job and education, the general sentiment implies they are handling their circumstances well. The narrative doesn't hint at intense stress."
"Consider this post: ""*""When thinking about life, remember this: No amount of guilt can solve the past, and no amount of anxiety can change the future. ""* This is a quote I stumbled upon a few years ago that still sticks with me to this very day. At face value it presents the idea that anxiety is fueled by the very nature of what it's foundation is based on; **nothing. ** I keep an open mind these days, in fact, one can argue a quite possibly *too* open mind."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The post indicates that the writer has found a quote which has had a lasting impact on them. They discuss having an open perspective, even hinting they might be too open-minded at times. However, there doesn't appear to be any significant emotional distress conveyed in their message. Instead, the tone is more contemplative and thoughtful than one of personal struggle."
"Consider this post: ""Not sure the best way to describe it but for the last week and a half I have had to be social and around people every day except for a couple of hours each evening and it is KILLING ME. I’m on edge constantly because I need a break to just start over. And now I’m on the way to a 3 day work seminar in another country and I feel like there is zero mental energy left. I get back and then have work on Monday again. Anyone else feel like they need a day or two alone to “recharge” their (mental) energy?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster explicitly mentions feeling ""on edge constantly"" and feeling like there's ""zero mental energy left."" They describe being overwhelmed by prolonged social interactions and express a desire for alone time to ""recharge"" mentally. The tone and content both suggest that they are feeling drained and stressed due to their current circumstances."
"Consider this post: ""I had poked fun at him for looking at /r/hentai or whatever a week or so ago, and I know I was pushing it too far, but I just thought it was amusing. I didn't think any less of him, and I told him that. I can understand him being embarrassed though. Anyway, last night I had been joking about looking at his browser history after seeing a recently viewed tab for porn. I figured it wasn't a big deal, since we both know each other's kinks and don't hide anything from each other (there's nothing worth hiding on either end)."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a situation where they poked fun at someone for their browsing habits, but there isn't strong evidence of personal distress or significant stress. While there may be some potential discomfort or awkwardness in the situation, the overall tone of the post suggests a more casual recounting of an event rather than a deeply stressful experience."
"Consider this post: ""I did a few times but it always just blew up in us breaking up and then me being miserable for awhile. I just don't know if I should bother anymore and commit to the fact that I'm alone and will probably be for the rest of my life. Both my brothers are married, most of my family members have partners apart from me so I sort of feel like the odd one out there. I'm sort of just unsure of what to do next.   ---"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language and tone of the post indicate feelings of sadness, resignation, and uncertainty. The poster mentions experiencing multiple breakups, feelings of misery, and a belief that they may remain alone for the rest of their life. These sentiments, combined with the comparison to their family members, suggest a sense of isolation and a perceived lack of belonging. The overall context of the post indicates emotional distress and a potential for stress."
"Consider this post: ""Should I stick around and save up my money? I mean college A and C are pretty good choices right? A is almost free and I could make the best of it, and C I could always figure things out my freshman year and then commute, and we could still see each other. Do you think we see each other too much? Should I limit my time with him?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster is questioning multiple aspects of their life, indicating indecision and uncertainty. They are contemplating the pros and cons of different colleges, as well as reevaluating the dynamics of their personal relationship. The use of multiple questions in succession shows a level of internal conflict, which can be indicative of stress."
"Consider this post: ""My wrists start to itch. My bruises from rock climbing and martial arts remind me of other, past bruises. Nightmares. I had such a fucking nightmare last night. Nightmare on top of nightmare."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The language used in the post reveals that the individual is dealing with both physical discomfort (itching wrists, bruises) and emotional distress (nightmares). The phrase ""Nightmare on top of nightmare"" suggests that the individual is facing recurring emotional turmoil, possibly reliving past traumas or experiencing intense negative emotions. This combination of physical and emotional challenges strongly suggests the presence of stress."
"Consider this post: ""But the life at dads was always kind of not ok? He drank and was angry a lot. His moods would change quickly and at times it was hard to figure out why he was angry. He yelled and throw things and sometimes shoved me around too, but me he never got that physical with like he did with my oldest brother. My dad also cried a lot and forced me to listen to him talk about his sad childhoos and then had me comfort him."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The description of life with their father reveals an unstable and emotionally turbulent environment. The father's frequent drinking, anger, mood swings, and physical aggression, even if it was more severe towards the oldest brother, are sources of stress. Moreover, the role reversal where the child is made to listen and comfort the father about his traumatic childhood further adds emotional strain. Such an environment can result in emotional distress and long-term stress for the individual recounting these experiences."
"Consider this post: ""So, I've been homeless since about the first, but I was expecting this. What I wasn't expecting was the changes I've made in my life since becoming homeless. Thankfully I have a job, so I do have money. But I hate everywhere that's affordable to eat! I've been a big junk food/fast food fan for years, so I'm a bit overweight, but lately, I just don't seem to care for meat as much, and fast food is just so.. gross right now."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The primary indication of potential stress is the fact that the poster has been homeless since the beginning of the month. Even if they anticipated this situation, being homeless is inherently stressful due to the uncertainties and challenges it presents. Additionally, while the poster has a job and thus some financial stability, their dissatisfaction with affordable food options can add to daily stress. Their shift in preferences and potential health concerns also hint at underlying stressors."
"Consider this post: ""I've had other things happening - lack of direction in life, nervousness about getting a job, feeling lonely by neglecting friends to do work and internships. I don't know if I don't love him anymore. I don't know if I can get past my resentment. I don't know. **Tl'dr: I feel numb to my boyfriend after a series of arguments/events that have left me not feeling loved or like a priority to my boyfriend."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster mentions several factors indicating potential stress. They express a lack of direction in life, nervousness about securing employment, feelings of loneliness due to prioritizing work over personal relationships, and issues within their romantic relationship, including feeling unloved and not prioritized. The accumulation of these concerns and the expressed uncertainty about their feelings towards their boyfriend suggests a state of emotional turmoil and potential stress."
"Consider this post: ""I don't feel like he's in love with me and I question my feelings for him. I don't know if I'm being clingy or he was being cruel and I'm overreacting. I don't know if my numbness is caused by other stress in my life. What do I do. **"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses doubt and uncertainty about their partner's feelings and their own feelings towards their partner. The use of phrases such as ""I don't know"" multiple times suggests confusion and inner turmoil. The mention of feeling ""numb"" and questioning whether this numbness might be related to other stressors in their life further indicates emotional distress and potential stress. The urgency in their tone, as emphasized by the final ""What do I do,"" suggests a state of concern and tension."
"Consider this post: ""But I just can’t do what I need to do because I am terrified that I am doing the “wrong” thing, regardless of what decision I make. But the current situation (doing nothing) is extremely detrimental as well. I feel like a total loser and I am deeply ashamed of this anxiety, though I know that it is nothing to be ashamed of. I’m confident in so many areas of my life, but anxiety targets me and I become immovable. This is one of those times."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster explicitly mentions feelings of terror, shame, and being ""deeply ashamed"" of their anxiety. The fact that they feel paralyzed in their decision-making due to fear of making the ""wrong"" choice indicates significant emotional turmoil. Additionally, the contrast they draw between their usual confidence and the immobilizing effect of anxiety during ""one of those times"" further highlights the depth of their distress. The reference to their current situation as ""extremely detrimental"" also points to the adverse impact of their anxiety on their well-being."
"Consider this post: ""They weep after every session with me and all I can do is give them the thousand yard stare. I don't even know how to feel yet my girlfriend says I'm selfless to a fault how I can be I don't know she always says she wishes she could have rescued kid me from my mother and has been the saint of a women that is still by my side and still wants to marry me. How and why I don't know I feel worthless ans like I have nothing to offer up other than my love and the constant promise I'll never leave her. I have lashed out so many times at her for things not even done by her and I die inside a little more everytime I do. I know she knows why it happens and understands the brain chimstry behind my psych issues as she is a sociology and psychology major/minor."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes deep emotional reactions such as weeping and feelings of worthlessness. They also mention the strain in their relationship, as evidenced by instances of lashing out at their girlfriend and feeling regret afterwards. The reference to their past with their mother, the need to be ""rescued,"" and the mention of their psychological issues all indicate significant emotional turmoil and stress."
"Consider this post: ""Sorry for the essay, poor grammar and punctuation. Thursday night. I asked a friend what they were up to tonight by text and instantly got a phone call after. Now usually I’d  ignore their called calls due to the worry of having an awkward phone conversation. This time I answer and we agree for them to come over."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","No, the poster does not suffer from stress. Reasoning: While the poster does show some level of social anxiety or discomfort (evidenced by their tendency to ignore phone calls due to the fear of awkwardness), the fact that they chose to answer the phone and invite the friend over suggests they might be trying to overcome or confront this fear."
"Consider this post: ""It started with a panic attack that led to hypertension. I felt my heart pounding with shortness of breath. I felt dizzy, and I thought I was having a heart attack, this was the first time I ever experienced this. I thought I was going to die. I went to the ER."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes experiencing a panic attack with symptoms such as heart pounding, shortness of breath, dizziness, and the fear that they were having a heart attack. These are classic symptoms of a severe anxiety episode. Additionally, the intensity of the experience led them to seek emergency medical care, further indicating the stress and concern they felt about their well-being."
"Consider this post: ""My ""symptoms"": I know this probably isn't nothing compared what other people go through. I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old. But once every day, or every 2-3 days, I get intense, intrusive memories about these events. I feel extreme anger and hate, my heart rate goes sky high, sometimes even my hands start shaking."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes experiencing frequent and intense intrusive memories that are accompanied by strong emotional reactions, such as extreme anger and hate. Physiological symptoms like increased heart rate and hand tremors further indicate distress. The fact that these reactions occur once a day or every few days suggests that these memories significantly impact their daily well-being."
"Consider this post: ""My girlfriend and I have been amazingly strong for the last 8 months, shortly before new years she told me that she feels very much in ""love"" with me but ""doesnt feel right"". She wanted an unknown amount of time away from the relationship saying only a couple of weeks and still wanted to keep the same ground rules as when were together (monogomous, etc..) Shes vague when i try and talk to her about it, stating she just feels like somethings wrong and that shes doing this so she can fix her self and come back to 'us' stronger I talked to her again last night and as always shes adamant this is because she loves me and wants us to work more then anything... Shes never lied to me before, not even over little things so i have no reason to doubt her intentions. Basically i said i feel like her backup and i wanted to breakup untill this 'problem' is resolved so today we split for a month"" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster describes a tumultuous situation with their girlfriend, who has expressed feelings of uncertainty about their relationship. This has led to a temporary breakup, and the poster's feeling of being ""her backup"" suggests feelings of insecurity and confusion. The need to navigate these mixed signals, coupled with the lack of clarity about the future of the relationship, can be a significant source of stress."
"Consider this post: ""That's why I've come to you guys. \- If the formatting is weird, it's because it's midnight and I've edited this damn thing so many times I want to cut off my own hands so I can't torture myself with editing it any more. It's probably garbled af. Yes, I did proofread it, but I can't guarantee quality because it's midnight lmao. I'm super tired."" Question: Does the poster suffer from stress?","Yes, the poster suffers from stress. Reasoning: The poster expresses frustration with repeated edits, mentions wanting to ""cut off my own hands"" as a hyperbolic expression of that frustration, and alludes to their exhaustion from it being late at night. Their tone and the repeated emphasis on the time suggests they might be overwhelmed or experiencing some level of distress related to their current task."
