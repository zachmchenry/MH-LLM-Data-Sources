"Consider this post: ""Guided Meditation Disclaimer:  I am in no way saying meditation should be the sole method of treating bipolar disorder.  I wouldn't be stable enough to meditate without my meds.  Just sharing an experience.

I attended my first guided meditation session today and found it really helpful.  My mind has been racing for days.  Just random thoughts pushing out other random thoughts.  25 minutes in a dimly-lit room listening to the soothing voice of someone guiding images was nice.  

My mind wandered as she read, but she instructed me to acknowledge the thoughts and gently push them away.  PTSD tells me not to close my eyes in the room with a stranger; bipolar disorder tells me I can't sit still (mentally or physically) long enough to get through a guided meditation.  But get through it I did, and it was very helpful.  It was conducted in a little shop in our downtown area and only cost $5.  If you're interested in meditation, it might be something to check out in your area.

"Consider this post: ""Social anxiety after sex/masturbation Absolutely hate that this is a thing for me...
To sum it up, it's not regular social anxiety. On days where I'm fine, I feel fucking great. Confident, *extremely* social, etc. If anything, I'm naturally more of an outgoing person (esp growing up before this was a thing).

But the issue is my social anxiety is more induced after anything sexual. I spoke with a therapist briefly a year back and we did talk a bit about this and she did hypothesize that this is a mental thing (my parents were extremely religious and strict when it came to anything involving girls or sex so I might have internalized that). 

Anyways so the gist is if I jerk off, then I'm socially anxious that day and the day after. Exact same for sex, if I have sex, then for the day and the day after, I'm also anxious. I have no fucking clue why this is a thing and why it's induced by...essentially ejaculating. Bothers the fuck out of me that such a normal thing for almost every other guy is a thing that gets me socially anxious. It's hard with a girlfriend when sometimes you don't want to have sex if you're doing something social outside just so you won't have anxiety. Or even just jerking off at home but knowing the day after I'll be anxious.

What's fucked is I essentially live my life around this. If I know I have a job interview, or I'm going out on say the Wednesday, I'll jerk off or have sex on Saturday (and make sure I do nothing for the 5 days after) so I'm fine socially when the day comes. It's stupid and I don't know if there's even a fix. Alcohol sorta helps and I've tried taking 1mg of Ativan just a test, turns out not even that really did much. Is there a cure, this is seriously impacting my quality of life..."" Question: What mental disorder symptoms does this post show?","This post shows mental disorder symptoms related to anxiety.

But that word lost all it's emotional meaning to me along time ago. I lied to her about my intentions. I said I could see us getting married. I told her I wanted to move in with her. I really just wanted to move out of my parents house. I knew it was wrong to mislead her but i kept lying to myself about my true feelings. I actually said to myself, okay I'll break up with her but I want to have sex again. Or, I don't want to ruin christmas, I want to experience this other thing. I liked being able to say ""my girlfriend"" like it made me look good. I lead this girl on for a year and a half and I couldn't admit it to myself. I appeared to be the sweetest guy. I did nice boyfriend stuff. She met my family, I met hers. I gave every impression of being a legitimate good guy. I finally couldn't take being unhappy anymore, so I thought I would just end it and we'd both go our separate ways like nothing had happened. We had actually almost broken up once before because I told her I didn't feel comfortable having sex because of my faith. My faith is a sham. And I'm a hypocrite. My life is basically ruined. My parents are very religious, they are christians, and so living with a girl before marriage is definitely a sin and I could see how I was disappointing them and everyone at my church(we actually went to church together). I just said that I didn't feel comfortable living together and basically that she isn't a christian(this is so judgmental of me I wish I could take it back) and that I felt like I was using her to say I had a girlfriend and move out. When i confessed she told me that I deserved to be punished. She sold the house I basically invaded, and moved away to be with her new boyfriend(who she was thinking about leaving me for anyway). I can't live with myself knowing that what I've done may have hurt her in some way. It feels like my empathy and conscious have finally come back online. i've been reading about rape victims and how they can blame themselves and I know she is very independent so i worry she won't reach out for support.

"Consider this post: ""If you really want to make someone feel extra-extra loved, pay attention to the things they do to care for you or make you feel loved, and do those things. I’ve been feeling this lately, and it’s a hard feeling because it makes me feel selfish and entitled, but I try to tell myself that it’s okay to feel this way.

My family and my husband are amazing! My husband is probably the best person I know. He listens to me and is so kind. This Christmas, he’s gotten me so many awesome gifts that I’d forgotten I’d even wanted! He blows me away constantly with his affection and attention and he’s genuinely the best man and most wonderful partner.

There’s one thing I want though, that I know I may never ask for. Maybe not anytime soon.

Something to know is that we are a blended family. He’s been in my life for 3 years and recently became step-dad to my 6yo daughter who he adores. My daughter has a huge loving family including my awesome ex husband (her dad) and we have tons of support, so while I don’t even have my daughter 100% of the time, when I do have her, my attention is focused almost entirely on her.

One thing I do as a spouse and parent to make my family feel loved is to simply take care of them. I want them to have a tidy, organized space where they can be happy, grow, work, learn, and feel relaxed. I enjoy cleaning the house and cooking meals and doing chores no one asks me to do, like laundry, straight down to putting it away. No one likes to do that stuff, but I do it BECAUSE no one likes to do it and I know it feels good when you get home and it’s already done. My husband loves my daughter and will take her out sometimes so I can relax alone, but he still isn’t used to being woken up early by a child and can get kind of grumbly, so I wake up sometimes after having only 5ish hours of sleep just so that I can be awake when she wakes up so as to avoid having her crawl into our bed and wake him up and get on his early-morning nerves.

Like I said earlier, he is so loving. He really does pay attention and often does things that make it clear to me that he cares about how I feel and that he wants to surprise me and make me feel appreciated.

But more than anything—any gift, any special note, any hug or kiss—here is what I want:

I want a day where I can be with my precious love—my little girl—and totally enjoy her without having stress about her needs. I want him to wake up with her, make her breakfast, lunch, etc.

And I want a day where he cleans the whole house and makes dinner and I don’t have to lift a finger.

The thing is: while he values tidiness and cleanliness to a degree, he cleans when he thinks something needs to be cleaned, ergo, I don’t think he interprets 90% of the work I do in that regard as an act of love, so much as he just sees it as me taking care of things I deem responsibilities. If anything, he wouldn’t care or notice if I skipped a Saturday of cleaning. He wouldn’t care if I quit trying new recipes to make dinners from.

If I stopped showing him love in HIS language—notes, physical affection, verbal affection—he would notice. He would hate that.

But I don’t think he fully understands that the physical effort and energy I put into caring for him and my daughter every day is how I show love. I don’t have to clean as much as I do, or work at being so organized, or cook meals. They don’t expect or need those things, mostly because they’re amazing people who are both (daughter included) fairly low-maintenance and don’t view me as a female workhorse. In fact, my husband often invites me to slow down and relax.

When he does invite me to slow down and relax, though, I often wish he would take over. If I’m doing the dishes, I don’t want to hear, “Love, you don’t have to do that, I’ll get it later.” I want to hear, “Hey, go"" Question: What mental disorder symptoms does this post show?","This post shows no mental disorder symptoms.

"Consider this post: ""To quit or not to quick...Drinking I love to drink. That's it, alcohol is my favorite thing to ""do"". Sure, I do other things but drinking just makes me feel like who I'm supposed to be. It makes me funnier, confident, skillful, and gets other humans to surround me just because. Alcohol has been there for me in the darkest storms and in the proudest moments. Then again on the other hand it's the monkey on my back, the annoying cut inside your mouth that you can't stop messing with to heal on its own. Time and time again drinking is a issue that gets me into the deep end of the ""life"" swimming pool. Idk, Getting these words out finally instead of just thinking about it in my head is pretty fun.

"Consider this post: ""The people who treated me like shit in high school now want to apologise and be my friend. I have no interest in forgiving them. I was a weird kid. Aspergers, clothes that were 3-times hand-me-downs and 5 sizes too large, crooked teeth, no understanding of makeup or fashion, a complete nerd, a weird accent. Other kids teased me in primary school, and boys just used me and took advantage of my low self-esteem in high school. 

But now I'm different. Now I have money, and friends, and I travel all over the place. I know how to socialise and dress nicely. Recently I posted some pictures from my latest trip, and lo-and-behold, now I'm getting messages from the same people who bullied me and took advantage of me only a few years ago. They want to apologise and ""go back to being friends"", as though we were ever friends to begin with. They want me to come over and have drinks with them and more of the old group of ""popular kids"". 

Just no. They can apologise all they want, but I don't have to forgive them. I've moved on now, and I neither want nor need their approval. I don't want to reconcile things. I have enough friends who weren't massive dicks to me in the past. I don't want to be their friend now.

"Consider this post: ""Spring is coming. Let's talk hypomania and blue light. With spring coming in the northern hemisphere this is just a reminder about the importance of light exposure in BD.  It's kind of my thing as it's been the most helpful non-medication treatment for me.

If you aren't aware of the importance of blue light in BD it's real.  Blocking blue light can [reduce manic symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5089565/).  Total darkness can [stop rapid cycling](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/bipolar-disorder-light-and-darkness/dark-therapy/).  Add to that seasonal affective disorder lamps reducing the symptoms of depression and we have a real non-medication treatment option.  

The bottom line is [read this](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/bipolar-disorder-light-and-darkness/).  Actually, read the [whole site](http://psycheducation.org/) because its one of the best resources for BD info out there.  

Treatment is cheap.

If you decide to play around with light exposure, ~~even~~ especially if you are skeptical, be careful.  Your doctor should know if you are fiddling with blue light blocking glasses and absolutely **without question** needs to know before you start with a light box.  Track your mood.

And a closing note that it literally took me years, and being on the right meds, to figure out how to use light therapy effectively.  It's not even close to being a silver bullet.  None the less, its one of the most helpful tools I have."" Question: What mental disorder symptoms does this post show?","This post shows mental disorder symptoms related to bipolar disorder.
