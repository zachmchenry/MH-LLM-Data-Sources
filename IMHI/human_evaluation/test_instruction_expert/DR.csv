"Consider this post: ""Ancestry.com - is it safe?
Hello!: )

I'm a new user so if this post ends up in a weird place/thread, pls bear w me.

Has anyone used Ancestry.com lately? They offer a two week trial but still require your credit card information. Is this suspicious? It doesn't cost anything for the first two weeks, and then you can end the trial so you don't have to pay anything even then, but I just feel a little uncomfortable dialing my credit card information on there online.... Am I being too doubtfull? Share your experiences?

Thank you!

If my English isn't perfect, that's because I'm not a native speaker."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post showed no signs of depression, the poster was simply seeking advice from the internet about whether or not the site was safe, it was a post that had nothing to do with emotions."
"Consider this post: ""A vent more than advice post
my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon
shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave

she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me""

half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his.""

and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row.

not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me.

tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post tells of plans to go to a friend's playdate being repeatedly postponed due to interference from the friend's boyfriend, in which the poster indicates being put on hold and ignored, but this is only a sudden emotion in response to a specific event. There is no indication that the poster has been suffering from negative emotions for a long period of time, and the information presented in the post cannot point to depression."
"Consider this post: ""I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids?
I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post is intended to discuss when a person would want to have children and seeks everyone's opinion on the subject. The overall tone of the post is that of a rational discussion with no unnecessary display of emotion. Perhaps the poster has some confusion about life, but this does not point to the fact that they are suffering from any emotional issues in the long term."
"Consider this post: ""Anyone ever wish they were good at something?
Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is in a state of chronic unfulfillment, and they exhibit denial of their abilities, low self-esteem, and pessimism about the future, which points to the poster being in a chronically low mood state, which is one of the symptoms of depression."
"Consider this post: ""Who even cares anymore
I’ve just learned to accept my thought and I realise things aren’t gonna get better.I have the same cycle every day just play video games mourn for death wish I had weed and listen to sad songs till the morning life has just become such a boring shit show. Even talking to random people has me fucked up cause i fuck things up tell me guys what’s the point of even living anymore "" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post takes on a very negative tone, with the poster indulging in drugs and sad music and believing that life is meaningless and hopeless. The poster believes that talking to people screws things up, which points to low self-esteem and low self-achievement. These are all symptoms of depression."
"Consider this post: ""The one and only thing I want to and have a will to do is to listen to the music all day and space out in it.
Everything else is boring, draining and dull. And I receive no mental pleasure from doing anything else."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post describes a state of low desire, where the poster can't bring themselves to do anything but listen to music. Low interest in things, low motivation, and getting bored easily are all symptoms of depression. This indicates that the poster is in a more dangerous emotional state."
"Consider this post: ""Does everyone else just hurt all the time
It’s not like physical pain or soreness, it’s just this overwhelming feeling of exhaustion and numbness. Doing anything, from applying for jobs to walking my dog, is just so overwhelmingly exhausting and it feels like running a marathon.

I’ve tried everything - exercise, diet, meditation, meds. Nothing is working. Exercise just makes me tired. I’ve never gotten that rush of endorphins. I don’t have any hobbies that make me happy or that I can even focus on long enough to distract me. Every day is a huge ordeal"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Posts specify a sense of emotional pain, exhaustion, and numbness. The poster describes their life as a marathon that overloads them and no amount of trying can lift their pleasure. Such feelings of powerlessness, low meaning, and numbness are symptomatic of depression, which indicates that the poster is in deep mental torment."
"Consider this post: ""isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real?
There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why. 

Anyone else feel like this ? 

Sorry for terrible punctuation. "" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster began by questioning whether people think it's crazy for people who are not depressed to make fun of themselves for claiming to be depressed. The poster used to be able to be unaffected by this sort of thing but now has no ability to laugh off such behavior when they are in a meltdown. This suggests that the posters have been in stressful situations that have made them uncomfortable for a long time, which has traumatized them and triggered their depression."
"Consider this post: ""dealing with an emotionally unavailable best friend
I see my best friend a lot. I dont wear my heart on my sleeve but I'm emotional. I definitely give too much in a relationship and end up getting hurt because of it. My friend has troubles expressing her emotions and generally gets very annoyed when she has to ""prove herself"" because she feels like people should just trust her. She doesn't have many friends because of this. I always express my irrational feelings but when shes angry she doesnt want to say anything because she doesnt want to hurt me. I don't want her to hold anything in but I know that I would suffer because of the truth.

How do I balance our give and take? 
Is there anyway I can help her open up? Or is that impossible?
"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates emotional struggles, vulnerability, and challenges in their relationship with their friend, but these factors alone don't necessarily equate to depression.The focus of the post is on seeking solutions to the posters' dilemmas with their friend, which indicates that the overall tone of the post remains rational and positive."
"Consider this post: ""Not allowed to feel bad?
I feel like I'm not allowed to feel bad. I'm an unimportant piece of shit and there are so many other people that need help and all the other people are a lot more important than me. I'm not considered as a person, I'm just something to use to pull yourself up. It's like I'm stuck in a swamp and all the people step on me and push me deeper down just to get out themselves. I guess I don't deserve to feel good. Noone will care if I will kill myself. They'll just use another person. "" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Posters put themselves down and infinitely elevate the importance of others, their emotional freedom is taken away from them in the posters' narratives, they see themselves as something insignificant and even mention suicidal thoughts. The poster is expressing feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and thoughts of self-harm, which are indicators of serious emotional distress and possibly depression."
"Consider this post: ""I starve myself
When I get depressed, I just can not eat. Everything sounds so gross and eating just seems difficult. I’m a very small person, 5’4 and 100 pounds. It’s something I’m self conscious about but weight gain has always been a struggle for me. I’ll go through periods where I’m doing well and eat 3x a day and manage to put on a few pounds, but then something happens and I slip back into my old ways and the weight falls right back off. Does anyone else do this? "" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster mentions experiencing depression and associates depressive episodes with a loss of appetite. Losing interest in activities one used to enjoy, including eating, is one of the symptoms commonly associated with depression. Additionally, changes in appetite and weight, either loss or gain, can be indicative of depressive episodes for many individuals."
"Consider this post: ""Should I meet estranged grandfather?
I've never met my  grandfather due to him and my grandmother being divorced, and my mother being the ""least favorite"" wants nothing to do with him. However her siblings are super close to him and my cousins have known him their whole lives. I'm not aware of any physical abuse that happened but I know verbal towards my mother and grandmother and their appearances and capabilities occurred as well as blaming my mother for the divorce. He has attempted to apologize to my mother for years and sends her cards which she throws away or returns. If physical occurred I would not want to meet him and I'm wondering if my mother is acting the way she is because she's hiding something.

Also he has never reached out to me but my aunts say he asks about me regularly. He may have not reached out due to the fact my mother won't speak to him. But part of me doesn't want to care if he's not willing to reach out. I'm torn.... Any advice?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster is expressing a dilemma about whether or not to meet their estranged grandfather and is considering various family dynamics and past issues. While they are clearly facing emotional challenges and confusion related to their family's history, there isn't direct evidence in the text to conclude that they are suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""No friend left behind? *short*
I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least). 
Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship. 
Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her.
I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way. I feel like if they didn’t want to be friends anymore they should say something to her to give her a fair chance.
Am I overthinking this or on track?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster is expressing feelings of discomfort, conflict, and a moral dilemma concerning their group of friends' behavior. They're empathetic towards the friend being excluded and are concerned about the ethics of the situation.While the post suggests feelings of unease and distress regarding the situation, it doesn't directly provide evidence that the poster is suffering from depression. The emotions conveyed are related to a specific circumstance involving friendships and a moral standpoint, rather than broader symptoms or feelings commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Does anyone else get such intrusive thoughts like “I hate myself, I should cut myself, I wanna die” that are so intense you have to say it out loud?
Sometimes when I get into a cycle of negative thoughts they are so strong and it’s just automatic that I say it out loud. Sometimes if just comes out as an “oh my god” but other times I actually say those thoughts to myself. Physically telling myself that I’m stupid, I have no worth, I wish I could die. Does anyone feel this compulsive need to say their thoughts out loud?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is trapped and defenseless in a compulsive mindset of self-loathing, wanting to self-harm, and wanting to commit suicide. The poster is expressing symptoms often associated with serious emotional distress or depression, specifically mentioning intrusive thoughts and self-harming tendencies."
"Consider this post: ""No one is gonna read this
Nobody likes me and every time I interact on reddit i tend to be a laughstock and receive a bunch of downvotes, because I'm a worthless piece of shit that shouldn't even be breathing. Just wish to be happy but that's impossible, my only purpose is to choke on a fat dick and die because i'm a faggot"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post uses intense expressions that suggest profound self-deprecation and a sense of worthlessness. The individual conveys an impression that they are the subject of mockery and disdain, resulting in a sentiment of desolation and despondency. The allusion to a desire for an end and the use of negative self-descriptors indicate a deep emotional turmoil that resonates with characteristics often seen in severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Looking for friends.
I'm a socially awkward college student that'd like to make some friends. Not necessarily hangin out (would be nice sometimes) but just want people to talk too, so it's all good if you don't live near me. :)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster express a desire for social connection and admit to being socially awkward, which might indicate feelings of loneliness or difficulty in forming social bonds. However, these feelings are not uncommon among college students or people in general, and it doesn't necessarily mean they are suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""When will this inescapable wait ever end?
I feel as though this is never ending and nothing good will ever come out of it. I’m underserving. I have both a long-term mental illness and a long-term physical illness. One’s willpower is limited. I struggle everyday both 
 physically and mentally/emotionally. It’s been years. My physical illness affects my mental illness and vice versa but they are offend uncontrollable! I suffer from chronic low self-esteem due to my illnesses. I don’t know I just feel hopeless and helpless. My willpower feels drained. I don’t know how much longer I can keep holding on. It’s not holding on that’s difficult. What’s difficult is holding on when there may be no meaning to it. What if I hold on with all my will and I find out there’s nothing to it. My whole life would’ve just been meaningless suffering. I keep trying but sometimes it’s really hard and I’m scared and lonely. "" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: Based on the poster's message, they are expressing symptoms that are often associated with depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, low self-esteem, and prolonged suffering both mentally and physically. They also mention having a long-term mental illness, which further points towards ongoing mental health challenges."
"Consider this post: ""I've been having suicidal thoughts more than ever...
I feel like I fail at everything, I don't have any motivation to clean or really do anything. I feel like I'm no good at anything and have gotten really lazy.
I'm not the best wife and I've made many mistakes. If i asked my husband to do something and he didn't I'd complain to try and get help. If he's not doing anything I wouldn't either. Now that he's moved out I feel like I don't really have any reason to live.
I used to smoke weed but had to stop a little under a month ago cause I got arrested (on my anniversary) and am facing felony charges on something that's legal. I've had to hire a lawyer and everything to try to keep my record clean.
I've had suicidal thoughts since I was in high school and kind of turned smoking a bowl into my medicine so I would always refuse depression meds. I've heard mixed things about them, and I'm scared on how they would take effect on me. 
But since the arrest I've been getting progressively worse and worse. My husband was the one who initially got me to quit hurting myself and the thoughts keep haunting me more than ever. One of the biggest reasons I haven't been able to bring myself to doing it again is I care for others more than myself. I couldn't hurt my friends and family like that but I'm mentally going insane..."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster directly mentions having suicidal thoughts, since high school, which suggests a long-standing history of mental health challenges, and indicates a high level of distress.They also describes a perception of failing at everything and lacking motivation. The poster exhibits multiple indicators of severe emotional and psychological distress, consistent with depressive disorders. The combination of longstanding mental health struggles, recent traumatic events (like the arrest), loss of coping mechanisms, interpersonal difficulties, and the expressed suicidal ideation creates an alarming picture."
"Consider this post: ""Possessive friends
Hi there, this is my first post.
I became friends with a girl from my new class this year (who i had never met until we came into the same class) and became good friends with each other.She has a big network of friends and is quite different from me(talks to everyone, likes everyone, an extrovert). One day, a boy who happens to be her best friend saw us talking and got angry(for the life of me, i do not know why) and started making fake rumors about me, which she blindly believed. when she came to confront me about these false allegations, i flipped out and got quite angry and i have not talked to her for 3 days.
Her friends are determined to hate me for some unknown reason and at the same time the girl has to problem with this, even defending them, saying that they are just very possessive of her.
I am in a dilemma on what to do, ignore the hate or to stop caring and ignore her."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster is expressing distress and confusion due to interpersonal conflicts with friends. They describe issues of trust, misunderstandings, and a feeling of being targeted by rumors. The text focuses on navigating a complex friendship dynamic and determining how to respond to the situation. While this certainly indicates emotional turmoil, there's no direct indication of depression in the description. Instead, the concerns are primarily about how to manage this particular challenging situation with friends."
"Consider this post: ""Why do people try to motivate depressives using shame?
I never understand the idea of people attempting to shame me out of my depression.

""How do you live like this? Why are you being like this? Your brothers aren't like this?""

If we're going to have a face off over who has the lower opinion of me, I guarantee, I will win every time. Or at least I hope I will because if not they hate me more than I can imagine.

I feel awful about even saying that, I see the weakness in that statement, the defeatism, but that doesn't make it any less true."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster is expressing feelings commonly associated with depression. They highlight external misunderstandings about their condition, exhibit significantly low self-worth, and recognize their own negative thought patterns but feel trapped in them. Their sentiments suggest they are struggling with depressive feelings and possibly a depressive disorder."
"Consider this post: ""How would you describe your life at this point?
I literally feel like my life is a complete crap! I’ve been holding my feelings in(self doubt, emotionally unstable) it’s been rough! I just quit my job because it was causing more panic attacks ...so now I’m without a job and still depressed! Basically life sucks for me!!!!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster is expressing feelings and situations that are commonly associated with depression. They mention feelings of self-doubt, emotional instability, experiencing panic attacks due to work stress, and a sense of hopelessness regarding their life situation.

"Consider this post: ""I think about multiple ways of killing myself everyday but I can't bring myself to do it.
I'm so done feeling so so alone. I have friends who I can talk to, but I feel like I'm burdening them everytime. I'm pretty much done with my life. my studies are going nowhere, and I have no motivation in life.

I thought of running into the road, but I wouldn't want to be that selfish and traumatise some innocent driver. I thought of throwing myself off the building, but I wouldn't want my family to be burdened with that gruesome image. "" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster is expressing very clear and concerning symptoms of severe depression or a related mental health condition. They mention recurrent suicidal ideation, feelings of isolation, the perception of being a burden to others, a lack of motivation, and a sense of hopelessness about their future. These are all significant warning signs."
"Consider this post: ""does it ever feel like your friends arent really there?
I genuinely care for and love my friends so I regularly ask them how they're doing on messenger since they all live so far away. I know my friends struggle with depression so I make it a point to contact them and let them know I'm here for them. 
But most times I am left on ""read"" or get lukewarm responses, as though they are annoyed. They don't really initiate conversation with me and rarely ask me how I'm doing.
I hope I don't sound selfish in any way, but it just feels weird to care so much for people who don't seem to care that much for you. It hurts sometimes that I also struggle with depression but have no one to talk to.."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster emphasizes feeling like their friends aren't really there for them despite their efforts to reach out.They mention feeling hurt by the perception that their friends don't care as much for them as they do for their friends.They openly state that they struggle with depression and express feelings of loneliness and lack of support.The feelings of perceived isolation, coupled with their explicit mention of struggling with depression and lacking a support system, strongly indicate that the poster may be suffering from depression or experiencing depressive symptoms."
"Consider this post: ""That orange message-notification...
It makes me happy, wanted, feeling like I belong. I love comments because I feel so alone in all of this. Even if the comment didn't help a lot, I feel like I'm not alone. Oh god I'm so miserable.

EDIT: No its not a cry for attention or likes or upvotes. I sincerely feel good when I see the people of /r/depression commenting on my posts, and I love commenting on theirs. A mutual feeling of belonging..."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The emphasis on the joy derived from a simple message notification suggests a deep yearning for connection and validation.The explicit statement ""Oh god I'm so miserable"" clearly expresses distress.Their appreciation for the community of /r/depression and the mutual feeling of belonging they get from it indicates a search for understanding and shared experiences with others who are likely going through similar struggles.They clarify that their sentiment isn't just a cry for attention, suggesting an awareness of potential judgments but a sincere appreciation for the community support.The combination of these expressions indicates a person who is seeking connection and feels isolated in their experience. Their direct admission of feeling miserable further supports the likelihood that they may be suffering from depression or experiencing depressive symptoms."
"Consider this post: ""Nothing is enjoyable anymore.
Almost everything that I used to care for is simply starting to have no meaning. I feel dead and lifeless.

I used to be very passionate with certain things but that was usually meant with me being bashed and shunned upon people. Or simply just a turn off. 

Everyday I wake up and I’m angry. Always wondering what the hell the point of this is. Why I’m here. 

I used to be extremely suicidal in the past and I’m slowly falling into that dark pit again. I don’t know what to do.

It’s so hard to be happy and I’m just... I’m starting to give up."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster mentions that activities and passions they once enjoyed now hold no meaning for them. ""I feel dead and lifeless"" indicate severe emotional distress and feelings of emptiness.They reference negative reactions from others when they expressed their passions, which can contribute to feelings of isolation or rejection.The daily anger and existential questioning (""wondering what the hell the point of this is"") show persistent negative emotions.The poster acknowledges a history of severe suicidal thoughts and expresses concern about returning to that state. ""It’s so hard to be happy"" and ""I’m starting to give up"" convey a sense of hopelessness and despair.These feelings and sentiments are strong indicators that the poster may be suffering from depression or a related mental health condition."
"Consider this post: ""I don't know what I am living for...
I honestly don't know why I keep living another day, I have no one to love me, my very friends are dick heads, my parents don't care how i am feeling and when they do they just throw a bible verse at my face acting as if talking to some sky man is going to cure me, I have yet to even hug a girl in my life, probably because I'm such an ugly awkward beta shit... I have no plans for my future, I am overall retarded In school. All I can do is be an escapist by playing video games, watching videos, eating unhealthy food, and all i do is isolate myself from reality... My therapist is overall useless, all she does is repeat the same shit I hear from people... 

I honestly don't comprehend why I won't just end it all..."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster conveys a profound sense of hopelessness and despair. They express a lack of understanding of their purpose in life and feel a significant disconnection from meaningful relationships. They describe themselves using highly negative terms and exhibit tendencies toward escapism as a means to cope. The individual's mention of therapy suggests they've sought help but haven't found it beneficial. Importantly, there's an explicit expression of suicidal ideation in the content, indicating an acute level of distress."
"Consider this post: ""Classmate/ bullying problems
I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do.

For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about ""fake people"", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty.

I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome. Thank you"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster describes a classmate who exhibits aggressive, domineering, and confrontational behavior. This individual seems to be seeking control over their peers, often resorting to public humiliation and indirect, passive-aggressive tactics rather than direct communication. The bully's actions cause distress among classmates, and attempts to involve authority figures like teachers haven't been successful.While the behaviors described are indicative of someone with potentially deep-seated issues or insecurities, it's not conclusive evidence that the aggressive classmate suffers from depression."
"Consider this post: ""When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc.
I have no idea how to respond. My emotions have become so numb  that I can't feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There's nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I don't know what else to say.

It's the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I don't even look forward to coming home from work because it's not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It's all the same dullness. I'd probably work 12-14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it wouldn't bother me at all, I'm not missing out on anything. Too bad they don't because they don't want to pay overtime for me of course."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster communicates a profound sense of numbness and disinterest in activities that people typically find enjoyable. They report an inability to feel emotions, resulting in a lack of enjoyment in previously liked activities. Their routine is monotonous, revolving around work and aimless browsing, with no anticipation of leisure or relaxation even after a workday. They express a preference for prolonged work hours, not out of passion, but seemingly as a way to fill the emptiness they experience.The poster's expressed feelings of emotional numbness, lack of enjoyment, and a monotonous daily routine strongly suggest they may be suffering from depression. The numbness and lack of interest in activities are common symptoms of depression."
"Consider this post: ""100% always try to be a nice friend but sometimes i dont want to, am i mean

"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The poster appears to be dealing with social dynamics and the complexities of friendships in a grad school setting. While they express some feelings of guilt and uncertainty about their actions, the information given does not provide strong evidence that the poster is suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""The good times don't make the bad times worth living.
People always act like it's worth living through bad times so you can experience the good times but to me it doesn't feel worth it. Even the good times are tainted and I can barely ever even ""enjoy"" them the way I'm supposed to. They barely even make it into the picture when I think about my life."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster conveys a feeling of despondency about life's ups and downs. They express that even during what are supposed to be ""good times"", they can't fully appreciate or enjoy them. The sentiment that life's positive moments don't outweigh the negative ones for them is a recurring theme in their words. Furthermore, the poster feels detached or distant from the typical joys of life, suggesting that positive moments have little to no impact on their overall perception of their existence. The poster displays signs that are commonly associated with feelings of depression, such as anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure), a negative outlook on life, and a feeling that life's challenges outweigh its rewards. The sentiment expressed about not finding worth in the good times due to the pervasive presence of the bad times is indicative of a depressive mindset."
"Consider this post: ""My mom caught me with someone, I lied and now she is mad...
tl;dr: Mom caught me with someone and also caught me in a big lie.

My mom (F54) caught me in a huge lie as well after that, because I was trying to get her out of the house, things have been complicated since I've been lying.

Today she arrived sooner than expected and well what i was trying to avoid happened. She is telling me I'm like a 14 year old and doesn't understand why i've done this. That I don't do shit despite me doing house stuff, and working. That ""I was your age too"" conversation happened.

I'm 22 years old and I'm thinking about moving out and doing my own thing, but I feel like I don't need to update people every 10 minutes, is that just me?

I don't think I have been lying to her, I just didn't told her I was seeing someone, and to be honest what was she expecting me to say??

To be honest I don't know what to do, can you guys help me dealing with this?? I kinda feel worthless at this point too because of all the things she said to me"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""My hands won't do what I want them to.
I know I know I've ranted about not being able to do anything artistic a thousand times now, but this is different.

A few times I've forced myself to draw I was garbage, but I figured that's to be expected since I haven't done it in a while. However lately I've found playing video games much more difficult because I find myself pressing the wrong button almost purposely, or not reacting to something my brain processed seconds ago. It's even gotten to the point where typing is difficult for me--every other letter I find myself making a stupid typo, and its irritating. It shouldn't take every ounce of will and concentration to type a stupid reddit post, yet here we are........""

"Consider this post: ""Does anybody feel like their life is meaningless if they don’t have a relationship or crush
In my opinion it feels like love is the only medicine strong enough to cure my depression. Whenever I’m in love or lust I’m on top of the world I feel so good everything feels great, but once something happens to it I fall down this hole and my depression comes back even stronger. I need to learn to be their for me to grow love for myself. That almost seems impossible but I won’t give up and I’m going to work on becoming a better me.

I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what?
