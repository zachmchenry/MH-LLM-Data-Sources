Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way.  It drives me nuts, and feeds into the __lack and white thinking_ that plagues me.  So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether.  Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice.  He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else.  I__ thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills.  But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them.  I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year.  I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds.  I just needed to vent.  I feel like I have no one and nothing.  I constantly mutter things under my breath (often without realizing it) such as __ hate my life._  It__ just hard to see how the story of my life turns out well.""

I didn't think i was capapble of love. But he liked me. He liked me for what I was. He didn't see this thin, blonde girl with scars. He saw something different.

But, he got back with his second ex who then abused him some more. She would cut if he wouldn't talk to her, laugh at his misfortunes. I was the one he went crying to every damn time. I was there when nobody else was.

They broke up, big suprise and he asked me out. I said yes and entered two happiest months of my life. Followed by the 4 most miserable months until he finally showed me mercy and dumped me.

He would constantly mock how skinny and pale I am. How my scars are easily noticeable, gee I never noticed. Laughed at my stories of abuse. But I loved him. I was stupid and I deserved to hurt. He would cut himself and encourage me to. I'm actually 7 months clean as of today but it's so hard not to go back.

Now he's back with his ex again. And I hope he suffers. Bad. I'm tired of being used. I'm tired of being a freak. Why was I born this way? Why am I hated so? Fine. I give up.

"Consider this post: ""Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. 

I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to.

Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic.  I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow.  At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. 

My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design.  Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do,  sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways.  I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side,  which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking.

I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. 

I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough)  movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability.  But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail,  that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. 

Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life,  that I cant really live life at all.  So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking  day? 

I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family.  Even then,  Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways.  But Ive been thinking about it more often lately

I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now. 

Thanks for reading my griping if you got this far."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to jobs and career. Reasoning: The poster recounts their 26 years of singleness to express a desire for a romantic relationship, and the inability to move forward in a relationship with someone successfully makes the poster feel pathetic about themselves. The poster also described the current state of work, working two shifts but neither of which they enjoyed or had prospects for advancement. There is a lack of courage to try for the job they like.

"Consider this post: ""I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.

Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.

Some health problems I have are:
 I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.

things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:
I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.
For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.

I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.

I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  

The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  

I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.

A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.

I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.  

Any help is greatly appreciated. "" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to jobs and career. Reasoning: The postings recounted many problems such as loneliness, lack of self-sufficiency, social anxiety, depression, anger and allergies, which suggests a variety of factors contributing to the posters' emotional problems. They mention seeking psychiatrists and taking medication for their mental illness, but the situation has not improved much. The posting highlights the posters' current struggles with finding a job, which suggests that Jobs and career related issues are currently a major source of stress for the poster."
"Consider this post: ""Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. 

But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. 

But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. 

Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. 

And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? 

Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard. 

I'm going to go do that list of morning stuff, because at least it'll keep things from getting worse. But I just wish it didn't feel so futile.""

"Consider this post: ""I know I sound weak a d pathetic for this but my parents are splitting and I have no idea how to even cope with it. I am losing my hope and I don't know how even face a day. At the moment I think the only way out is to kill myself and I don't think anyone would care. There is really nothing left for me to enjoy maybe I deserve to suffer and kill myself..."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions that the parents are splitting up giving the poster a great deal of emotional shock, which indicates that family relationships are the main source of stress for the poster at the moment.

"Consider this post: ""So this girl and I have been talking a while and I slowly started liking her more, I have extreme emotions and the only one I learned to control was anger so my other ones go Willy nilly, I haven't been diagnosed because they don't know what to diagnose it as. She started off by giving very blatant signals, so we started being flirty etc I asked her out and the date is in a few days, she was my +1 to a new year's party and we cuddled most of the time and kissed and as she left I walked her to the car. Then I talked to her yesterday morning  and I haven't talked to her since but she has seen my message. I know I'm overreacting and over thinking but I can't get over all my stress and anxiety about it, I realize it's likely nothing but I'm very stressed out.

Update: were 17 so her mom found out there was pot at new year's and said she can't go on our dinner and movie date but we will be going on a lunch date"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship.
