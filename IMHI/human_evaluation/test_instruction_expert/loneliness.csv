And nothing has changed. I still feel the same. It's been 12 months and I'm just even more tired. I don't even feel anything anymore besides the occasional crippling sadness/loneliness. I binge and I don't feel anything anymore. I buy things and I don't feel anything anymore. I've been struggling and working so hard to change and nothing has changed.

No one invited me anywhere and I don't blame them. I'm not angry that he went, I am angry at myself. I have no friends, live miles away from any family and at the age of almost 28 have nothing to live for. I try to stay upbeat but I really don't see the point.

For the record, I am 19 years old, male and incredibly lonely. I've never been in a romantic relationship and I don't see it happening anytime soon. Normally my job is unbearable to begin with.

Sure, it'll be depressing knowing that everyone else will be out tonight having fun, but it's all so superficial; get drunk, yell happy near years, feel like crap in the morning and resume regular life the next day.

And finally last night I told her everything and she was the first person to not down play my problems or end the friendship on the spot. She told me that she will be there to support me through everything and even told me she liked me a lot. But I'm hesitant to start a relationship because every relationship I've been in has ended after a month at most because of the way I am and I don't want to lose her as a friend.

My friends are having a potluck, but I just want to sleep. Last time I hung out, I didn't feel like I fit in. It takes so much energy to leave the house. What do I do here? I can barely function. :( I was taking Adderall and desipramine before, but last term was rough. After school ended, I stopped taking the Adderall, as I noticed that I grew tolerant to it. I'm scared to try another medication. I don't really want to go to this potluck, either. I just want to sleep.""

I got back in touch with the one girl I ever truely loved. Now we don't talk to each other anymore - but at least she found her someone, and she's doing better now. I'm not. I don't have any friends to get drunk with tonight. So I'll be hitting the gin on my own until I pass out and hopefully I'll choke on my own vomit. But I digress. What I was trying to say, apart from telling the whole world 'O how I'm sad, is that I know plenty of you guys and girls are in the same position. Remembering that we're together in our loneliness is creepily heartwarming. Here's to hoping for a better 2017 - but it won't happen, right?

This isn't really by choice it just seems I can never get close to more than 2 or 3 people at a time. Anywho, both of them moved really far away in the last few weeks. The only people I was going to have to spend New Years with were my parents and as a 27 year old that is already depressing but now they won't even make it home till tomorrow night due some travel mishaps. Now I'm feeling really alone and isolated. I know I'm not really alone but I'm already really down after my friends moving that being alone tonight is hurting me badly.

"Consider this post: ""That's so embarrassing, humiliating and so frustrating especially on these last days of holidays. I mean, this person is with his/her loved one, people she cares about.

"Consider this post: ""Just a sense of impending doom, this year is going to be shit. I felt the same last year and I was right, 2016 was awful.

Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post directly shows loneliness. The poster acknowledges feelings of loneliness and assumes that others on the platform may feel the same way. They then suggest a virtual ""party"" to help everyone feel less isolated by sharing something funny."
"Consider this post: ""No one loves me, I have no friends, I'm spending new years alone in my bed. I refuse to take my anti depressants because I'm scared they will make me happy and I don't deserve happiness because i'm an awful person and everyone leaves me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post directly shows loneliness. The poster explicitly mentions not being loved, having no friends, and spending New Year's alone, highlighting their isolation. The sentiment about not taking antidepressants out of a belief that they don't deserve happiness further emphasizes their sense of self-deprecation and isolation."
"Consider this post: ""Earlier this year my uncle was looking for someone to work for him. The job was very interesting to me. It's the kind of job I was truly interested in. Long story short I needed to go to school for a course that took 4 months to work for my uncle. Once I was done with the course my uncle told me he had already found someone else. But here's the thing. He's the one who found the course and told me to go and do it. I was so ready for the job and I feel so frustrated that I did the course for basically no good reason. It really felt like my golden ticket for a better life and now I can't find a job anywhere."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: While the post expresses frustration, disappointment, and the feeling of a missed opportunity, it doesn't directly show loneliness. The primary focus is on the betrayal or letdown by the uncle and the difficulty of finding a job. The poster's feelings are more related to unfulfilled expectations and professional setbacks rather than feelings of isolation or loneliness."
"Consider this post: ""For reference, I'm female and 25. So many times I find myself wanting to see a specialist to see if they can help me, but I don't know what's even wrong with me. I'll be fine some days, but then something might happen or I'll get in my own head and things get so much worse. Before I've been able to deal with it, but last night something happened and I felt truly and utterly alone for the first time in my life and I wondered what I was even doing here. Why I'm living when I'm doing nothing with my life. I'm tired of feeling so terrible and convincing myself that I'm just a burden, but I don't know if there are places to help me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post directly shows feelings of loneliness. The individual expresses experiencing a moment where they felt ""truly and utterly alone for the first time in my life"" and grapples with feelings of purposelessness and being a burden. The overarching theme of seeking help and understanding further emphasizes the feeling of isolation and loneliness."
"Consider this post: ""Title. I'm still reluctant as hell to go to a doctor and get myself diagnosed. I know I need meds, but I don't *want* them. I don't want to be on meds for the rest of my life. Every year I say it'll be better this year and I muster all the mental power I can, and temporarily it works. But eventually I wear myself out and I fall into a deeper pit. It happens every. Single. Year."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: The post does not directly show feelings of loneliness. The post focuses on the individual's reluctance to seek medical help and their concerns about long-term medication. It also discusses the cyclical nature of their mental health struggles. While there are implications of emotional struggles, there is no explicit mention of feeling isolated or alone."
"Consider this post: ""Not sure this is the right place to post this but here it goes anyway. I have been hit hard with what I think is depression (have several symptoms) but it kind of makes me numb and not really care about shit anymore. I used to care about everything a lot and got anxious about everything, overthought everything. But now, I may not feel the best, but it's very relieving to finally lose my worries and detach from any pressure I may have had from my friends and family. Currently I don't really care enough to want to get better because I like that I finally can stop caring. Just wondering if anyone else has gone through this. Wanted to post and ask what others thought."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: The post does not directly show feelings of loneliness. The post discusses the individual's feelings of depression, numbness, and the relief they feel from not caring about things anymore. While there is a mention of detachment from friends and family, the primary focus is on their internal feelings and the changes in their emotional state. The feeling of isolation or loneliness is not explicitly conveyed."
"Consider this post: ""That's all. I have no value, nothing to offer anyone, and everyone knows it. If I act exceptionally nice and let people use me I can get them to spend time with me sometimes. But no one actually gives the slightest fuck about me. There's no one to share in my successes, no one who's there for me when I'm extra sad, no one who cares about what I'm thinking, no one who even enjoys my company. I'm just worthless"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post directly shows feelings of loneliness. The writer expresses feeling undervalued and believes that no one genuinely cares about them. They mention having no one to share experiences with or turn to in times of need, which emphasizes their sense of isolation and longing for connection. The statement ""no one who even enjoys my company"" is a direct reference to loneliness."
