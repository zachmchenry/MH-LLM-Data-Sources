Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling unable to make anyone happy and feeling like a burden to others. This indicates a perception of being a burden and a lack of self-worth, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.

Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a history of being able to overcome depression in the past, suggesting that they have experienced periods of connectedness and belongingness before. This implies that the current state of depression may be disrupting their sense of belongingness. 
2. They mention having a lot going on, including family health issues and burdens, which can contribute to feelings of emotional distress and potentially isolate them from others. 
3. The individual highlights their husband and their cats as positive aspects of their life, which may indicate that they do have some sources of support and connectedness. However, they still express a struggle with depression and feeling worse despite trying medication, suggesting a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in their current state of connectedness. 
4. The mention of needing commitment to get out of bed and the doubts about having anything left to keep trying may reflect a sense of hopelessness and inadequacy in their ability to form meaningful connections and overcome their depression."

The post does mention feelings of depression and difficulty in overcoming it, which can be risk factors for perceived burdensomeness. However, it also mentions having a lot of good things in life, such as a supportive husband, friendly cats, and a nice house. These positive factors may serve as protective factors against perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also talks about having heavy burdens, such as a father living in the hospital and a mother with angina, as well as unreliable siblings. These stressors could potentially contribute to feelings of being a burden, but it is important to note that the post does not explicitly express thoughts of being better off gone.
3. The post mentions trying medication and feeling worse than usual, but also acknowledges efforts to fill the days and maintain commitments. This suggests a resilience and determination to keep going, which may mitigate the risk of perceived burdensomeness.
Overall, while there are some indications of potential risk factors for perceived burdensomeness in the post, the presence of positive factors and coping strategies suggest that the individual may not be currently experiencing this mental state."

"Consider this post: ""Its irony when my mom keeps bugging me like why wont I spend my time to talk with her instead of me sulking in my bedroom when everytime I talk to her,she always manage to either compare me with one of her friend's child who are far way more successful or reminds me of how much my dad not wanting me.I wish I was never alive."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling bugged by their mother, indicating a potential interpersonal conflict or lack of positive connection with their mother.
2. The individual describes their mother comparing them to others and reminding them of their father's rejection, which suggests a lack of support and understanding in their relationship with their mother.
3. The individual expresses a desire to not be alive, which is a strong indicator of feelings of despair and inadequacy in terms of connectedness and belongingness.
Overall, the post shows risk of thwarted belongingness due to strained interpersonal relationships and feelings of worthlessness."

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like a burden indirectly through the mention of being compared to more successful children and feeling unwanted by the father. These thoughts and comparisons can contribute to a negative self-perception and perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post expresses a desire to not be alive, which suggests a significant level of distress and feelings of hopelessness. This can be a potential indicator of perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post also mentions a specific trigger for these feelings, which is the mother's comments about spending time together and comparisons to others. This interpersonal factor can contribute to the perceived burdensomeness."
"Consider this post: ""Basically, I developed a really big crush on this girl. It was the only time I've ever seen my self being in a relationship. And get this! She had a crush on me too! I was so happy. I was going to ask her out last night at a NYE party, it's the only reason I went. But I missed my chance. Whatever, I'm hanging out with her and some other people tomorrow, I'll ask her then. Never-fucking-mind. I got a text from her a couple hours ago. She said she just wanted to be friends. I respected her, I didn't want to be a creep like a guy from r/incels. I told her I got it. I didn't get it. She liked me last night. I know she did. And today she didn't. I don't get now feelings for a person could come and go like that. The worst part? One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November. I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain. I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts. I just want to be clear, I still want to be her friend. But I still have a crush on her, despite what she made me do. All my old coping mechanisms didn't work. I can't get her out of my head. I can't stop thinking of it'd be different if I asked her out last night."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship and mentions feeling happy when they found out the girl they had a crush on liked them back. This indicates a need for connectedness and validation through romantic relationships.
2. The individual experiences intense disappointment and confusion when the girl changes her mind and wants to be just friends. This suggests a sense of rejection and potential feelings of inadequacy in forming and maintaining relationships.
3. The individual mentions engaging in self-harm as a way to cope with the emotional pain caused by the rejection. This demonstrates a maladaptive coping mechanism, which can be indicative of experiencing psychological distress due to a lack of connectedness or belongingness.
4. The individual voices a recurring obsession with the girl and difficulty moving on from the rejection. This suggests a preoccupation with the relationship and difficulty detaching oneself from the idea of being in a romantic relationship, potentially indicating a deeper longing for belongingness."

"Consider this post: ""My dad has had a long history of cheating on my mom, every time though he always denies it. I don't understand it, what exactly is he protecting with his pride? Does he not see what's happening to my mom?! Everyday since Christmas, my mom has been on the verge of tears and my dad still either doesn't notice or doesn't care. The problem is that my mom and I are both powerless because my dad has us under his money. I don't know what to do anymore; we still haven't confronted him about it because (1) he'll just deny it and (2) it's his word against ours. My dads family is wealthy and they're all a bunch of fucking elitists and my dads family protects him like he's an angel. My aunt and brother, in the past, instead of going after my dad for his shit, they instead put all the blame on my mother. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIT PEOPLE?! My mother has been through 2 cancers and survived, had just retired form her stressful office space and now she's being treated like this by some shithead of a father?! Idk what else to do, I just recovered from my depression. I think I might go through with my promise and look for a gun this time around, it seems like a fair escape from all this shit."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: Yes, the post does mention a high level of distress and feelings of powerlessness, but it primarily focuses on the individual's anger towards their father and their family dynamics. While there may be underlying issues of emotional disconnectedness and inadequate belongingness, the individual's main concerns in this post are related to their father's infidelity, their mother's suffering, and their anger towards their family. The mention of feeling like a fair escape from all the problems does raise concerns about potential risk, but it is not explicitly related to a lack of connectedness. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded that there is a clear risk of thwarted belongingness in this post."

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does mention feeling powerless and not knowing what to do anymore, which can indicate distress and possibly a desire to escape from the situation. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness.

2. The post expresses anger and frustration towards the father and the family members who blame the mother. While these emotions are understandable given the situation, they do not directly suggest a perception of being a burden on others.

3. The post mentions the individual recovering from depression and contemplating looking for a gun as a possible escape. This statement is concerning and indicates a risk for suicidal ideation, but it does not specifically relate to perceived burdensomeness.

Overall, while the post does contain distressing content and thoughts of escape, there is not enough evidence to conclude a specific risk of perceived burdensomeness. However, it is important to take the individual's expressed distress seriously and encourage them to seek professional help and support."
"Consider this post: ""I wish I had a person to have a big argument with. Why? Because it‚Äôs a way to let my anger out and that person gets to call me names."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses a desire for a big argument, which suggests a need for emotional release and an outlet for anger. This desire indicates potential pent-up frustrations or negative emotions that are not currently being addressed or expressed.

2. The individual mentions that the person they argue with gets to call them names. This suggests a potential willingness to tolerate or accept verbal abuse in exchange for an opportunity to express anger. This may indicate a lack of self-worth or a sense of being undeserving of healthy conflict resolution.

3. The individual wishes for a person to have this argument with, which implies a desire for connection and engagement. However, the way they express this desire (through arguing and name-calling) may indicate a difficulty in forming and maintaining healthy, constructive relationships. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness, as the individual may be struggling with interpersonal conflict and ineffective communication."

"Consider this post: ""Home life is really bad at the moment, both parents are alcoholics and recently their drinking had been getting a lot worse. It's cause both sides of my family to argue due to my parents lack of care over my younger sister. I want to move out but I do not have the money, I don't really have anywhere to go, I want to call social services on my parents (again) but I can't as I'll be kicked out and have my belongings potentially trashed. My parents have never been there for me, I didn't have the best childhood, which has caused me to have an unfortunate array of mental disorders and depression. But now I'm starting to think I'll win the lottery of 1 million and everything will be okay, I keep thinking I'm going to win money and then I can move out and give me and my sister a better life for both of us. It's getting to the point that I'm daydreaming constantly of winning a large sum of money, and that I can get my own place and my sister will be okay. Ive started to genuinely think I'm a millionare. I'm that depressed I'm having unrealistic dreams and thoughts of the future so I don't think of what's happening at home and I don't know what to do. I don't get a lot of money to my self, I cannot get a job due to health/mental health reasons, even though I'd like to work. Everything is getting worse again and it feels like my brain is struggling on ways to cope with it."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual describes a dysfunctional and chaotic home life, with both parents being alcoholics and neglecting their younger sister. This suggests a lack of emotional support and stability within the family, which can contribute to feelings of disconnectedness.
2. The individual mentions wanting to move out but lacking the financial means to do so, indicating a potential lack of options or resources for improving their living situation. This can further contribute to a sense of not belonging or feeling trapped.
3. The individual expresses a belief that winning the lottery will solve their problems and provide a better life for themselves and their sister. This unrealistic daydreaming can be seen as a coping mechanism to escape from their current distressing circumstances, further indicating a potential lack of connectedness and dissatisfaction with their current situation.
4. The individual talks about their mental disorders and depression, which may result from the traumatic experiences and lack of support in their childhood. This suggests a potential risk of thwarted belongingness as they are experiencing psychological pain as a result of their inadequate connectedness.
Overall, the combination of a dysfunctional home life, financial constraints, unrealistic escape fantasies, and mental health struggles indicates a risk of thwarted belongingness in this post."

"Consider this post: ""My mom wont stop criticizing the movies and YouTube I watch only for the swearing.. I'm 20 years old.. they really help me with my depression. Especially YMS, movie channels, Michael Reeves.. I swear in private A LOT but never in front of my parents. I just think it's funny how THATS the problem when I feel like fucking garbage... not when i was assaulted (groped) not when i came home crying when i was bullied mercilessly.. not when I cry to her that nobody loves me (literally says I'm being manipulative when I do and I'm doing it for attention) not when I slashed my thighs when she told me that if I didnt graduate college I would be a loser that relys on welfare homeless and a drug addict. Not when she has thrown shit at me when I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.. no swearing is the problem..."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feelings of being criticized by the poster's mother for the movies and YouTube they watch, specifically focusing on the issue of swearing. This indicates interpersonal conflict and potential feelings of being a burden, as the mother's criticism may make the poster feel that their preferences are not accepted or valued.
2. The post also mentions that these movies and YouTube channels help the poster with their depression. This suggests that the poster relies on these forms of media for emotional support, and if they are being criticized for it, it may contribute to feelings of being a burden or not being understood.
3. The post goes on to mention various traumatic experiences, including assault, bullying, self-harm, and emotional abuse from the mother. These experiences can significantly impact one's mental well-being and can contribute to a sense of perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post expresses frustration and disbelief that swearing is being prioritized as a problem, rather than the more significant issues mentioned (assault, bullying, emotional abuse). This suggests a lack of understanding or validation from the mother, which can further contribute to feelings of being a burden and not being taken seriously.
5. Overall, the post shows several interpersonal risk factors for perceived burdensomeness, including criticism from the mother, reliance on media for emotional support, traumatic experiences, and a lack of understanding and validation within the family dynamic."

"Consider this post: ""Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself.

I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have. These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference. I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me.

I have been staying with friends and I spend some time in crisis accommodation provided by my psychologist after I finally opened up to her about everything they have been doing to me, and it's just been really hard. I'm having trouble getting the legal documents I need to secure a stable living situation, in my country so much of that is reliant on parental confirmation even though I am a legal adult, and I met up with my mum today to try and talk things out with her but I got brutalised and put down and just made to feel really worthless all over again. She couldn't even not be cruel to me after meeting for just one day after not seeing eachother for awhile, so I have decided to go no contact. I feel really helpless. I feel like the systems in place quite literally fuck you over if you have abusive families, needing their birth certificates to verify things. I feel like it has been made near impossible for me to live independently without them but I know I can never go back because they have put me through so much trauma and so many things I know to not be okay and they have no remorse, and I'm never going to put up with that ever again. I really don't want to go on anymore, I feel so weak, I have been trying so hard to get everything in order for 10 days straight and it has amounted to nothing, and I really feel like I have no other choice,"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions being in a ""really shitty situation"" with parents who have treated the person awfully for years. This indicates a history of mistreatment and potentially abusive relationships, which can contribute to feelings of low self-worth and perceived burdensomeness.
2. The person states that they are now homeless and struggling to secure stable living arrangements. This lack of stability and support can further exacerbate feelings of helplessness and being a burden.
3. The post expresses frustration with the systems in place that make it difficult to live independently without parental confirmation. This sense of being trapped and dependent on abusive family members can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
4. The person mentions feeling weak and like they have no other choice. These feelings of hopelessness and desperation can be indicators of perceived burdensomeness and a possible risk for considering self-harm or suicide."

2. The statement ""there's nothing else to it"" implies a sense of hopelessness or resignation, which can also contribute to feelings of burden.
3. While the post does not explicitly mention thoughts of being better off gone, the feelings of being unwanted and the sense of hopelessness can be indicators of perceived burdensomeness. However, without explicit mention of these thoughts, the label cannot be definitively assigned."

"Consider this post: ""Hey guys, first time playing here, just wanted to get some opinions.

Reasoning: The individual in this post expresses several risk factors for thwarted belongingness and a psychologically-painful mental state. 

1. They mention a history of bipolar manic depression, indicating a pre-existing mental disturbance that can contribute to feelings of disconnectedness and inadequacy in forming and maintaining relationships.
2. The individual shares their struggle with maintaining an inflated image and pretending to be someone they are not, which suggests a lack of authentic connections and difficulty in establishing genuine relationships.

These experiences can contribute to a negative self-perception, which is a risk factor for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions being diagnosed with bipolar manic depression and using substances (smoking weed) to cope with their problems. These mental health challenges and reliance on substances can further contribute to a sense of burden and difficulties in opening up in relationships.
3. The post expresses feelings of emptiness, trouble finding oneself, and difficulty in opening up in relationships, particularly with females. These difficulties in connecting with others and a negative self-image can increase the risk of perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post highlights a comparison to the past, where the individual remembers feeling confident and comfortable in their own skin. This contrast between the present and the past can contribute to a sense of burden and self-loathing, as the individual feels they have lost their previous attractive qualities.

In my dreamworld I would have 30min sessions, a couple of times a week where I snuggle to tv-series with a girl. But of course this is impossible to do. What came first the chicken or the egg? Maybe I'm just thinking too much about my depression, it could be very well be that my depression came first which is why it's impossible for me to find a partner. Has anyone had several years of no human contact, and then found a bf/gf only to have the depression continue uninterrupted?"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling lonely and attributes the depression to a lack of physical contact with other humans. This indicates a potential interpersonal risk factor for perceived burdensomeness, as loneliness and social isolation can contribute to feelings of being a burden on others. 
2. The post expresses frustration with the lack of improvement from treatment, suggesting a continued struggle with depression. This ongoing depressive state could potentially contribute to perceived burdensomeness. 
3. The post mentions a desire for physical contact and a dream of snuggling with someone while watching TV. This can be interpreted as a longing for intimacy and connection, which can be related to perceived burdensomeness if the individual feels unlovable or unworthy of such relationships. 
4. The post also questions the cause and effect relationship between depression and lack of human contact, suggesting a deep contemplation of their own experiences and potential explanations for their struggles. This internal rumination can contribute to a negative self-perception and increase the risk of perceived burdensomeness. 
Overall, while the post does not explicitly state thoughts of being better off gone, it does exhibit several risk factors for perceived burdensomeness related to interpersonal factors and negative self-perception."

This indicates a desire for change and improvement but does not necessarily negate the presence of perceived burdensomeness. It is possible that the individual is still experiencing thoughts of burden even while holding onto hope for a better future."

Reasoning: The post suggests a risk of thwarted belongingness due to several interpersonal risk factors:

1. The individual expresses feeling incomplete and envious of seeing their beloved ones succeed. This suggests a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in their own life, which can lead to feelings of isolation and inadequacy in terms of connectedness.

2. The person mentions losing hope in their beliefs and not having any impact on their life. This can contribute to a sense of disconnection and a lack of purpose or meaning, further exacerbating feelings of thwarted belongingness.

3. The individual also asks questions about how to move forward, what to expect, and who to rely on when everything is failing. This indicates a struggle in forming and maintaining meaningful relationships, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and a lack of connectedness.

2. The post also expresses feeling like everything is failing and failing everyone. This suggests a sense of disappointment and frustration, but it does not directly indicate a belief that others would be better off without them. 
3. The post asks how others continue on and who they rely on when facing difficulties, implying a desire for support and guidance. This does not align with perceived burdensomeness, as it suggests a willingness to seek help rather than a belief that one is a burden."
"Consider this post: ""I was doing so good, the birds all sang in the morning, the aroma of the flowers; I had not been enticed by that smell in such a long time.

The post initially describes positive experiences and accomplishments, such as enjoying the morning birdsong, the aroma of flowers, cleaning the room, losing weight, and interacting with people. These positive experiences suggest a sense of joy and engagement in life, which are protective factors against perceived burdensomeness.

2. However, the post then takes a negative turn when the individual expresses a sudden shift in perspective and describes feelings of hopelessness and the belief that they will never be happy. While these thoughts may indicate depressive symptoms, they do not directly indicate a perception of burden or a desire to be gone.

3. The post mentions contemplating buying poison as a means to escape existence or returning to a ""prison cell."" This indicates a sense of desperation and possibly suicidal ideation. While this is a concerning statement, it does not specifically indicate perceived burdensomeness.

"Consider this post: ""Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with. I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions struggling with their mental health for a significant period of time, including a history of self-harm. This suggests a long-standing sense of psychological pain and potential feelings of inadequacy in terms of connectedness.

3. The individual mentions feeling alone and isolated, with friends distancing themselves because of their perceived negativity. This suggests a disruption in social relationships and a potential lack of support or understanding, which can contribute to a sense of thwarted belongingness.

4. The person also reveals thoughts of death and suicide, as well as writing notes for their closest friend and others. Such extreme feelings of despair and contemplating suicide can be associated with a profound sense of disconnection and an absence of belongingness.

"Consider this post: ""Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with. I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions struggling with mental health issues, including a history of self-harm and a current worsening of symptoms. These factors indicate a significant mental disturbance and potential risk for perceived burdensomeness.

2. The post describes social isolation and rejection from friends who no longer want to be around the individual due to their perceived negativity or constant bad mood. This rejection can further contribute to feelings of burden and worthlessness.

3. The post expresses a lack of excitement or happiness in life, with a constant state of indifference or unhappiness. This emotional state aligns with the risk factor of perceived burdensomeness.

4. The post contains explicit thoughts of wanting to die, perceiving it as an easier option and believing that few people would care. These thoughts of suicide and the belief that others would be better off without them reflect a high level of perceived burdensomeness.

5. The post also mentions feeling hesitant to open up to friends, as it becomes a competition of who has it worse and not feeling heard or supported by most people. This lack of support can reinforce the perception of being a burden.

6. The individual has gone as far as writing notes for their closest friend and a few other people, indicating a serious intent to end their life. This further highlights the risk of perceived burdensomeness and the urgency of intervention."
"Consider this post: ""I don't enjoy the ""nice"" things other people seem to enjoy. Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is ""How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing.""

And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter? To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow. Update: I haven't been able to talk to my mom as she's kind of having a 'quiet time' day and I don't want to bother her. I also have a question. Would it be unhealthy for her if I talk to her? She has anxiety/panic disorder and although she hasn't had a panic attack in several months I don't want to cause her too much stress. (Sorry I didn't mention this before),"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post explicitly mentions not wanting to live anymore and questioning the purpose of their existence. These thoughts indicate a significant level of despair and hopelessness, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post mentions self-harm behavior, such as cutting, and the concern of others seeing the scars. This suggests a negative self-perception and a desire to hide their struggles, which can contribute to feelings of burdensomeness.
3. The post expresses confusion and disbelief towards people who genuinely enjoy themselves and love themselves. This further highlights a lack of self-worth and a perception of being different from others, which can intensify the experience of perceived burdensomeness.
4. The post repeatedly emphasizes a lack of usefulness and a history of messing things up when trying to be helpful. This reinforces a negative self-perception and a belief that they do not contribute anything meaningful to others, further supporting the presence of perceived burdensomeness.
5. The update also reveals the hesitation to talk to their mother due to concerns about causing her stress, suggesting a sense of responsibility for others' well-being and a fear of burdening them. This is consistent with the interpersonal risk factors associated with perceived burdensomeness.
Overall, the post provides multiple indicators of perceived burdensomeness, including thoughts of not wanting to live, negative self-perception, self-harm behavior, a sense of being different from others, and feeling like a burden to loved ones."

Ive been bullied since grade 1, my father used to bias me when i was young, i was lied too by damn near everyone, lost my mom in 2018, attempted on multiple ocasions, nobody ever fucking listens to me, and im finally past my tipping point. I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life. EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all. I also have medication im going to down before i start to...attempt fully. If I live, I may (cant guarantee) re edit this post. Don't feel bad for me, I've wanted this. I ACTIVELY want this. So, thank you for taking the time to read this (though I doubt itll ever be seen) and goodbye."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post explicitly mentions feeling suicidal and being at the point of wanting to end their life. This is a strong indicator of perceived burdensomeness and a desire to escape from their perceived struggles.
2. The post mentions experiencing bullying since grade 1, biased treatment from their father, being lied to by multiple people, and the loss of their mother. These negative interpersonal experiences can contribute to feelings of being a burden and fuel the desire to end one's life.
3. The post describes previous suicide attempts and feeling unheard by others. These experiences further reinforce the sense of burdensomeness and contribute to a feeling of hopelessness.
4. The post includes specific plans for taking their life, mentioning the use of a knife and medication. This level of detail indicates a high level of distress and intention to carry out their plan.
Overall, the combination of explicit suicidal thoughts, negative interpersonal experiences, previous suicide attempts, and specific plans for self-harm strongly suggests a risk of perceived burdensomeness."

The post mentions multiple risk factors for perceived burdensomeness, such as feeling cold and worthless, thoughts of ending life, and a belief that tomorrow will be exactly the same. These indicate a negative self-perception and a lack of hope or purpose in life, which are key components of perceived burdensomeness. 2. The post also mentions overeating to the point of getting sick, neglecting self-care, and avoiding confronting their mental condition and traumas. These behaviors can be seen as self-destructive and may further contribute to feelings of being a burden and worthlessness. 3.

The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight. Tomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life.

"Consider this post: ""I've had a rough two weeks and can't study for shit right now. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone and thoughts of suicide are having a hayday. Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing. My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off. My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.""

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like a failure and thoughts of suicide. These thoughts indicate a negative self-perception and a lack of self-worth, which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also mentions feeling unable to talk to anyone and not being able to show their true emotions. This suggests a sense of isolation and an inability to seek support, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post describes a situation where the individual's family is already burdened with taking care of sick grandparents, and the individual feels guilty for not being able to help.

"Consider this post: ""I had a patient who was unconscious due to a large spontaneous brain hemorrhage. I remember just gazing at their face and thinking, they don't feel anything.

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post does mention a fleeting thought of whether it would be better if the patient didn't wake up. This thought could be seen as a reflection of perceived burdensomeness, as it implies that the patient's suffering would be alleviated if they didn't exist. However, it is important to note that this thought is immediately countered with a statement expressing a desire for the patient to wake up and for their life to be saved.
2. The post also includes a reflection on the poster's own sadness and acknowledges that they must be in a sad place at the moment to have such thoughts. This suggests that the thought of the patient not waking up is more of a reflection of the poster's own emotional state rather than a deep-seated belief of perceived burdensomeness.

The thing standing in the way of your dreams is that the person having them is **you**"" Not really looking to feel better, just wanted to rant and keep this pity party up for a bit longer. Anyway happy almost 2018, everyone!"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling like they bring little to the table as a person, which indicates a negative self-perception and a lack of self-worth, both of which are risk factors for perceived burdensomeness.
2. The post also expresses a belief that nothing will ever change and highlights a cycle of mediocrity. This suggests feelings of hopelessness and a belief that they are a hindrance to their own dreams, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.
3. The post mentions wanting to keep up a ""pity party"" and does not express a desire to feel better. This indicates a potential desire to dwell in negative emotions, which can further reinforce feelings of being a burden.
4. Overall, the post demonstrates several interpersonal risk factors for perceived burdensomeness, including negative self-perception, hopelessness, and a desire to remain in negative emotions. Therefore, the post shows risk of perceived burdensomeness."

It's strange because my anxiety hasn't been bad since starting. The reason i'm asking here is that my psychiatrist is on holidays and i dont see him until mid January. Any help would be appreciated.

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions the person's own depression, suggesting a potential negative self-perception and feelings of burden. 
2. The use of strong language (""Fucking hurt"") and mention of being ashamed suggest emotional distress and a lack of support, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness.

"Consider this post: ""I've never opened up to anyone, in person or anyone I know in person. I've only ever been honest when talking anonymously with strangers on the internet. Basically this lame nearly-20 year old has wanted to die for five years and I'm now at the point where it's get help or just do it already. so I changed doctors, the switch finally went through today, but I can't bring myself to schedule an appointment. I've lied to my family, friends (the one I still have lmao), and doctors for years. How can I be honest now? does anyone else struggle with this? being unable to open up? I've emotionally isolated myself due to fear of vulnerability and self hatred and I don't know if I could ever open up during therapy, let alone at a doctors appointment about requesting therapy. I get shakey and anxious and want to puke just thinking about it. It's so bad that I won't even come out as a lesbian, even though my family is very liberal and have told me multiple times if I was it'd be fine. but being honest/emotional/myself just feels terrifying. Obviously - I've never been in a relationship either because of it. How do I get over this (at least a little bit) so I can get help and medication?? I can't do 6 years. I barely made 5."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1.

This suggests a pattern of emotional isolation and difficulty in seeking support, which can contribute to perceived burdensomeness. 3. The post expresses fear, anxiety, and physical symptoms (shakiness, nausea) at the thought of opening up or seeking help. These emotional and physical reactions further indicate the intensity of the distress and the perceived difficulty in reaching out for assistance."

Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1.

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions various negative experiences and behaviors, such as plummeting grades, antagonizing friends, cutting ties with a crush, and hurting the mother. These experiences may contribute to a negative self-perception and feelings of disappointment in oneself. However, the post does not directly mention feeling like a burden or thinking others would be better off without them.
2. The statement ""There is no other reason holding me back from the other side"" suggests a possible implication of suicidal thoughts. However, it does not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness.

Someone I can trust. The fact that the simple thought of it gives me hope and makes me feel better means I know I'm right. I don't think it's a chemical issue in my case. It's a cyclical one, only eased when I drink several cans of beer before inevitably passing out since otherwise I WILL be up all night - no question. For the first time in my life I am ""looking more forward to"" (phrase used loosely since there aren't many things I can truly enjoy lately) work and this annoying festive vacation to end because I won't be alone with my thoughts. I WILL beat this. I HAVE to. And to anyone reading this post who feels the same way you CAN too. Sometimes, there are some things in life we just can't beat alone."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1.

3. The post expresses a determination to overcome their struggles and provides encouragement to others who may be experiencing similar feelings. This shows a sense of resilience and hope, which can also be protective against perceived burdensomeness.
Overall, while the post acknowledges significant emotional challenges, it does not directly indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness."

"Consider this post: ""It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog.

It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this. I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant. I hope anyone who currently feels as though they're in a trough can see that it won't always be this way, and there are sunnier days ahead.""

"Consider this post: ""hi.

I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions. I don't really care about anything and many of my thoughts are just wishing I could disappear or wishing I was ""less"" in every possible way. I want to not be alive so I don't feel the emotions I feel.

I dont want to lose the last friends i have but i dont know what to do. sorry if this post doesnt fit or whatever i just wanted to express whats on my mind thank you for your attention. also sorry for the bad english"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions having anxiety and feeling the need to invite friends over for a party in order to avoid being seen as weird or not wanting to hang out. These thoughts indicate a fear of social rejection and a desire to maintain social connections, but do not directly indicate perceived burdensomeness. 
2. The post also mentions not enjoying parties due to poverty and high anxiety when too many people are around. These factors may contribute to feelings of social inadequacy, but again do not directly indicate perceived burdensomeness. 
3. The post ends with an apology for the content and language, suggesting a possible self-critical tendency, but does not provide strong evidence for perceived burdensomeness."
"Consider this post: ""I'm scared and lost and I hate how I feel like this for weeks and then come out of it for a day or two then go back into it"" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling scared and lost, indicating a sense of distress and vulnerability. 2. They describe a cyclical pattern of feeling this way for weeks, then experiencing brief relief before returning to the same negative state. This suggests a chronic and unstable emotional state, which could be indicative of thwarted belongingness. 3. The post does not mention any specific social relationships or connections, but the individual's description of their emotional ups and downs implies a potential lack of stability and support in their social interactions."
"Consider this post: ""I'm scared and lost and I hate how I feel like this for weeks and then come out of it for a day or two then go back into it"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions feeling scared, lost, and hating how they feel, but does not directly express thoughts of burdensomeness or being better off gone.
2. The pattern of feeling this way for weeks and then having brief periods of relief suggests a cyclical nature of the emotional state, which could indicate a mood disorder like depression or bipolar disorder. However, it does not necessarily indicate perceived burdensomeness.
3. The response acknowledges the person's feelings and experiences, but does not suggest any risk factors of perceived burdensomeness. It is simply a supportive statement."
"Consider this post: ""I am going to keep living Tired of a lot of shit but fuck 'em, plenty of good in this world too.

Reasoning: 1. The individual mentions feeling detached from things that typically bring happiness to people, which suggests a disconnection from sources of belongingness.

The post mentions a difficult and uncomfortable medical treatment that is causing the individual to throw up. This can result in feeling miserable and frustrated, but it does not specifically indicate thoughts of being a burden or questioning one's worthiness. 2. The post expresses feelings of feeling ""so shit"" and questioning why they have to go through this, which suggests a general sense of frustration and discomfort with the situation. However, it does not directly relate to perceived burdensomeness. 3. The response also does not indicate any perceived burdensomeness.

3. The post also mentions physical pain from benzodiazepine and antidepressant withdrawal. Physical pain can impact mental well-being and contribute to feelings of hopelessness and burden.
4. The closing statement of ""love you all have a better life than me"" suggests a comparison between the poster's own life and the lives of others. This can indicate feelings of inferiority and a sense of being a burden compared to others.

Overall, the combination of thoughts of self-harm, lack of support system, physical pain, and feelings of inferiority and burdensomeness indicate a high risk of perceived burdensomeness in this post."

But hearing that argument convinces me that I'm essentially paying people to listen to me until I find someone that says the right thing to comfort/""save"" me. Maybe it's just my brain telling me that, but it just rationalizes my personal stigma towards seeking professional help for myself.""

"Consider this post: ""I am a male and am 16 years old, I took biology, chemistry, maths and philosophy for my A levels, and I don't know what to do. I had in mind that I would become a doctor, but then I read, that they have to mostly spend weekends working and work overtime. That made me depressed. I thought I had it all figured but, then I realised that I don't really know anymore if I want to become a doctor. I really don't know that much about myself, but I know that I can't be bothered to work over hours. I like to make songs, and sing, and edit videos, but I really don't know what career to take from those, especially since I have already started a level with those subjects. I was thinking of giving YouTube a go, but my parents most likely won't approve at all. Do I keep doing a medical course or stop? Should I try some new things whilst studying? I really need help, I am starting to just waste my life being depressed and thinking on how good all these social stars get paid, and don't have to go to college, whilst I am here just depressed thinking about my future."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1. The individual expresses feelings of depression and confusion about their career path, suggesting a potential lack of fulfillment or sense of inadequacy in their current situation.

These comparisons can further contribute to a sense of thwarted belongingness and dissatisfaction with one's own path.

We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay. I just really wanted physical attention and love at that point so I kissed him and straddled him and we made out for a while. Today he came over and we just hung out and played cards and stuff. He said we should go for a drive which we did and then he wanted to show me his apartment. We went inside and he showed me around. We went into his room and he took his jacket off and we started kissing a lot. I laid in his bed and he got on top of me and we made out some more.

However, law enforcement may still interpret this as a dangerous situation and take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of themselves and others. 3. The post demonstrates a level of distress and desperation, as the individual is contemplating extreme actions with a focus on the potential consequences. This indicates a potential risk of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may feel that their existence is a burden and that their only solution is through a potentially life-threatening act."

Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions suffering from depression, which is a mental disturbance that is associated with an increased risk of perceived burdensomeness. Depression often leads to negative self-perception and feelings of hopelessness, which can contribute to a sense of being a burden to others.
2. The post describes feeling trapped and unable to reach happiness, despite seeing others enjoying it. This sense of being unable to attain happiness can contribute to feelings of perceived burdensomeness, as the individual may interpret their inability to feel happiness as a burden on themselves and others.
3. The post mentions the frustration and discouragement caused by others suggesting that the lack of happiness is due to a lack of effort. This can further reinforce feelings of inadequacy and being a burden, as the individual may feel misunderstood and unsupported by others.
Overall, the post indicates several interpersonal risk factors for perceived burdensomeness, such as depression, feelings of hopelessness, and a sense of being unable to attain happiness."

"Consider this post: ""A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family.

"Consider this post: ""I've always struggled with depression, but I am at the lowest I've felt in a long time, I've pushed most of my friends and boyfriend away, family hardly talks to me. On top of it, my biggest stressor, I am drowning in debt, I am unable to find better employment, I live in a rural part of California without transportation, housing is scarce and expensive. My rent was just raised and I don't know how I am going to afford it.. I don't have family to turn to financially. My parents are well into their 70s, enjoying the end of their lives, and my brother is a drug dealer. On top of that my brother lives 5 hours away and my parents two states.. I survived a car accident in December of 2018. It left me carless and in a mountain of debt, on top of my other debts. The debt, the fact I can't seem to save or get ahead, I have no one to turn to, I am not really conventionally attractive either.. I just feel lost, depressed, numb, want the stress to go away, even for a moment. I miss my best friend (passed away just a few months ago, not sure if it was intentional or not but it was definitely an overdose, I was mad at him at the time and pushed him away and encouraged his binging.) The only thing still keeping me here is that I would feel guilty if my dog was left alone for days before my body could be found, and I don't want her to end up in the wrong hands.""

"Consider this post: ""Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful."" Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: The individual in the post describes their friend's struggles with mental health, specifically depression. While the friend is experiencing significant distress and risk of self-harm, the focus of the post is on finding ways to help and support the friend rather than expressing feelings of being disconnected or lacking belongingness. Therefore, the post does not indicate a risk of thwarted belongingness."

Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?","No, the post does not show this risk.

Been at the tipping point for a while now, although for some reason my death would upset some people so i refuse to do it as much as i want to. Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live. The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help?

It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded. I was blinded. Now I see. Its time has passed. Once it goes, I can live without imagined fear. Once it's gone, I can truly live. Tonight I go deeper. Tonight it howls in pain. Only the void listens. Tonight I will cry, but I won't turn. Tonight is the night my ego will die. Putting you out of your misery. Tomorrow I'll awake, but you'll no longer be here. I won't miss you."" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","No, the post does not show this risk. Reasoning: 1. The post mentions the ego as a selfish creature that demands to be the best and important, and throws tantrums when it feels small. These traits suggest a dissatisfaction with oneself and a desire for validation, but do not directly indicate feelings of burdensomeness or thoughts of being better off gone.

2. Although the post mentions suffering at the hands of the ego and being blinded by its delusions, it also expresses a sense of determination to overcome it and live without fear. This suggests a desire for personal growth and self-improvement, rather than a desire to escape from perceived burdensomeness.

3. The post does not directly mention feeling like a burden or being better off gone. It focuses more on the struggles with the ego and the hope for a better future without it.

Based on these reasons, the post does not show a clear risk of perceived burdensomeness."

Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues. How am I even supposed to properly deal with these issues when I'm constantly bombarded with all this schoolwork? How am I supposed to experience life and enjoy it when I'm trapped in an environment that worsens my mental health and anxiety? It's my last year of high school, but I still can't help but feel like I would be happier having dropped out. Realistically, the long term would look worse, but school environments are so toxic a lot of the time. The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal"" I'm just venting a little. I don't know if this would really make sense to other people, tbh I'm kinda fucked up mentally right now cause school is a bitch.

"Consider this post: ""Hi there, I'm looking for a best friend, as the post says so. Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do. My friends are real humans with feelings. I'm ready to invest effort, time and emotions into a friendship that is worth it, even if it's just online :) A little bit about me, I'm a 23 year old female. INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle...

I don't blame her, I bring all my problems to her and she's deeply caring but I think that's just the way she is. And if I got that happy birthday from her I would probably be relieved for a few minutes but that's it. It's just invalidating that the person I share the most to doesn't even really care about me, but my mind just might be jumping to conclusions. Anyways thanks for listening"" Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?","Yes, the post shows this risk. Reasoning: 1.

For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it. This is my first time admitting to this and I think its easier to admit in anonymity than to my family. They wouldn't understand these feelings and I inevitably chase all of my friends away. I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness. I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of ""okay-ness.""

Not only that but there are these people in my computing class who started out being my friends but slowly I think they are just starting to bully me too, there was this picture I uploaded 2 years ago to my Instagram of me in a onesie that they keep teasing me about, they even went so far as to print it off and put it in my pocket so as to piss my off when I find it. I really don't want to go back to college as I don't want to face all of this again, i really think it's going to break me and pull me back to cutting and sucical thoughts, even though the thoughts have already started again.
