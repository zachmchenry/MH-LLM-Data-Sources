I have numerous days were I am happy but then I just get back home and feel so depressed because it was a one-off.

I was born in another country and he already has two children of his own I guess this is why he doesn't pay attention to me.

I'm in a village with a handful of houses in a country i wasnt born in. I have dreams and I even turned my room into a little acomplishement zone to achieve mini goals so that one day I'll be able to accomplish those dreams.

A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. 

She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. 

She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. 

She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think.

She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle.

Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. 

The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. 

I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money.

She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. 

I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way.

Hopefully getting drunk... again...
So we invited the old man my mom looks after for dinner. We ate, he enjoyed it so did we all then after all that we took him home. Aftet that we went to the store and brought some echo falls, dissarrono ( can't spell for shit sorry ) and coke. I'm 16 so I gave my mom the money for it lol. 

So when we got home I decided to get pissed. Nearly drank the whole bottle of dissarrono in about an hour. Totally fucked. So my retarded self decided to have a breakdown and then tell my sister that I think about killing myself every day and night and that I hate my life so much. I was a mess. But she laughed while I was in tears. Funny right? I also pretend to slit my wrists with a fork which was the first thing I grabbed out of the cookery. Kinda wish I pulled out a knife. 

She didn't say a word about it in the morning nor did my mom who was upstairs trying to sleep. 

Few dayd past, family go to my step disters cousin's family party, so I go to my moms again, and decided to jam along to my music with my mom in the kitchen, it then got to the depressing music and it ended up my mom pretending to slit her wrists and said to me ""No wonder you've been feeling depressed listening to this shit"" I wish I said to her that it helps me or some crap like that.

I despise doing work and even though I'm pretty good at school (I'm a freshman in high school) I know I need to improve next year (first year at my school grades don't matter).

"Consider this post: ""TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine.  


...


Example, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. 

Go to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like ""Oh no, what the fuck is that!?"" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. 

I soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. 

Again, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. 

You end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. 

People at work say, ""Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down"", or ""I think i know what youre sad about"". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. 

You just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. 

We always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome. 

(This isnt well written, im never as smart on paper as i think i am in my head, but id love to hear if anyone relates to this or has any thoughts).

Reasoning: The post discusses the disconnect between how the poster feels mentally and how their body physically presents. They describe feeling fine mentally, but their face and body manifest depression and sadness, making it impossible for them to convey their true emotions to the world. This sense of alienation and disconnect between their internal state and external appearance is likely causing mental disorders for the poster, as they are unable to authentically express themselves and feel understood by others."

"Consider this post: ""Hi all, 

I am a 20 year old male in college and I have been going through an especially hard time lately, so I wanted to share my story with depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My hope is that my writing this out I can relieve some pain and maybe if anyone else is struggling with something similar they can feel comfort knowing they are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 years old, after I got a strep throat infection I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder such as ticks (biting my shirt, blinking my eyes excessively, craning my neck a certain way a lot). I worried about little things, such as if there was a seam on my sock or a tag on my shirt, I would feel so much discomfort that I could not wear it. When I worried about things, sometimes I felt pains in either side of my body, if I didn't feel the pain in the other side of my body it felt wrong and the decision I made in my head felt wrong.

Anyway, my ticks got worse after taking a certain medication that I forget the name of, and then they got better after I got off it. I started having more rituals, like washing my hands and walking across mirrors multiple times to get it ""right"". This later turned into more obsessive thoughts, which are what I primarily suffer from now. I am not in therapy right now and I am not taking any medication. In high school, I feel like I was happier because I had a small group of friends and a best friend who was a girl that I loved. A year later, I did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that. This was really hard for me at the time, she was so funny and genuinely nice I thought, she was absolutely beautiful and I took her to prom which was a shitty night because she ignored me most of the night. I ignored that red flag, and many others, I was 18 and I had never been in a relationship before and I fell for her hard.

After we stopped talking to each other, which was around December of 2016, I believe she texted me out of the blue in March of last year and we chatted a bit. That was all the contact we had until we saw each other at school when the semester started 4 months ago because she goes to the same college I do. It was good to see her, she told me she had a boyfriend that she broke up and he was an asshole, I had never met him. At the time I told myself that was okay she had moved on, I accepted that she was changing on and that I could move on too. I underestimated my feelings though because I ended up texting her and apologizing to her for whatever reason, and she apologized too. Things were well and good until I found out she had another boyfriend through a story she posted on Snapchat, and I freaked out. I blocked her phone number, Snapchat, Instagram and everything. I completely cut contact with her for 4 months. Until 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time recently as friends but she cut me off again and I don't know if I deserve it or not but it makes me feel bad of course.

I have a part time job, but it's not enough hours and I am going to see if I can't get more or maybe find something to do on the side. It makes me feel worse to not work or go to school and be around other people, I do not have any friends now, and I have been crying over something every day in recent months because of my depression. My family does not think I have depression, my mom has the key on the gate because she had postpartum depression and according to her that was real depression but not mine. I am just ""stir crazy"" from not working, and she is pushing me to get another job. When she says that to me it makes me feel invalid and worthless, which I feel like anyway pretty much anyway, I love her but I hate it when she makes me feel this way about myself. My dad does not think too much about my mental health, and neither does my mom's boyfriend.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with you all. It made me feel better to type it out as I have been having an extremely hard week. I was on a high because my best friend and I started talking again and spending time"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's struggles with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their history of experiencing symptoms since a young age. They also mention the impact of medication on their symptoms, with their ticks getting worse and then improving after stopping the medication. The post then delves into their experiences with relationships, particularly their intense feelings for a girl who they believed was their best friend. They describe the pain of the relationship not being reciprocated and the subsequent impact on their mental health. The post also mentions the poster's current lack of friends and the negative impact of not working or being around other people. They express feelings of worthlessness and invalidation from their family, which further contributes to their depression. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's relationship experiences and perceived lack of support from their family."

While it doesn't explicitly mention medication, the reference to depression suggests that the poster may be using medication as a method of managing their mental health.

"Consider this post: ""He has depression. He told me that he lost someone important to him and he's been feeling emotionless since. This person apparently passed away without warning and it was within the last month.

The poster is contemplating a dangerous and potentially fatal act of pointing a realistic-looking squirt gun at a cop, with the intention of being shot.

"Consider this post: ""I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. 

Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. 

My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 

2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. 

There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess. I wish I would just kill myself, instead."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to jobs and career. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling constantly suicidal, which suggests a long-standing and persistent mental health issue. The poster also mentions feeling guilty for their suicidal thoughts despite having a caring family and being well-off, indicating a sense of confusion and frustration about their feelings.

"Consider this post: ""I know I've probably said this countless times before, but fuck, when I think about the way that I act and speak I just get filled with this hatred and hopelessness. I can't stand myself, I don't know why I'm like this but I'm a god awful person to be around. 

I can't keep up a conversation to save my life, it seems like no matter what I'm just repulsive in every way. Nobody wants to talk to me for more than a few minutes, the amount of times I've been left ""on read"" as the cool kids say, is too many to count. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but at the same time I'm painfully aware of how awkward, unfunny, negative and all around incomprehensible I am. I can barely string together a coherent sentence.

It's like every time I try to talk to someone my mind just blanks and I don't know how to reply, no matter how much time I spend forming my response it's always hard to read trash. I can't do anything right, I'm mean, sarcastic, unfunny, awkward and just plain stupid with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst time. 

I'm just so hopeless, I'm so tired of being me and living with this irredeemable trash pile for a brain. It feels like there's nothing I can do to change or improve, no matter what I'll always be this rude sack of shit that's hated almost universally by everyone around them.

"Consider this post: ""So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing.

So a little about myself and why I am posting here now. I have been lurking in this subreddit on and off since I found out it existed, about 6 months back. I've been dealing with a lot of dark thoughts and surprisingly don't even want to get better. I have no idea where all of these dark thoughts are coming from since I had a good childhood and was always a nice guy and good friends that I could count on. However, since I started university (2 years ago, in my final year now), I've distanced myself from my friends and to some extent my family. There was no apparent reason for it. This distancing however lead to me realising my own feelings more and more and to some extent ""find my inner self"". All my life I've dealt with my issues by helping others resolve their and I've always gotten by one way or another, with me abandoning most of my friends this has led to me not being able to help others. As a result of that I've had to deal with my own problems on my own and had to face them. Let's just say that did not go well. I am 6 months away from graduating and have zero idea of what I want to do with my life. I have my parents counting on me to figure this out and frankly that pressure keeps getting me into panic attacks every time I think about it and I start breathing faster, my heart beat goes up and I just want to start shouting.

Im not close with any of them after they all turned on me when someone spread rumors about me once (long story, we sorted it out but i don't feel right about them after they hated me so quickly without question). 

I'm constantly terrified of being too obsessive around the people i like and driving them away, and that I'm way too desperate for a friendship or relationship i can feel good about. I get extremely self loathing around them and this causes those who i am close with to get annoyed at me i think. Im scared of opening up to anyone about how bad my self hatred has gotten because theyll just think it's juvenile (not sure about that myself tbh) or whether it's just me fishing for sympathy. I try to be nice to people but i think i take it to an extreme and be too apologetic of anything i think may annoy someone slightly.

"Consider this post: ""This is the first time I'm making the conscious effort to enjoy myself rather than wallow in my depression and self pity because nobody invited me to a NYE party. I've never before taken steps towards self care so that in itself is an accomplishment and I'm proud of it. Will I be back to my self destructive and self pitying ways soon? Who knows, but for just one day I'm going to allow myself to take care of me and if you've been looking for any encouragement or a sign to do the same then hopefully this is it. I've decided nobody gives a shit that you're laying in bed crying and the only person who can make me happy is myself if I just allow myself to enjoy things. Instead of purposely listening to that sad music when I'm already sad, I'm going to listen to my dumb 70's upbeat playlist.


Today is no different than any other day except for the fact that society deems it the start of a new year when in reality time is just a construct. The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct. The sun will still set and rise like it does everyday.


If you give in to looking at social media you will see people getting drunk and what appears to be having fun. Realize that yes, some of these people are genuinely out having a good time, but a majority of it is making things appear better than they really are. They're not posting pictures of people sitting on a chair scrolling through their phones (which is what happens for 90% of the time at the majority of parties), they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun and shit is wild and right after the camera shutter goes off they're back to scrolling on their phones. Some of them are probably feeling fed up and wishing it was over. Some of them probably feel just as alone as they do when there's nobody around (and that's truly a worse feeling). I know this was true back when I used to get invited to parties. You, on the other hand, are at home surrounded by things you can enjoy. Movies, TV, video games, books, hobbies like drawing, you name it. Would you really be happier at that party?


Anyway, I'm going to wrap this post up because, like I said, I have a day of fun shit to do by myself. If you're not ready to take the step towards self care, I get it. I've been depressed for a hell of a long time and never taken this step. But today I woke up and decided to do it. It'll happen for you eventually if it's not happening now. Happy NYE guys.



My plan as well as tips for tonight:


- Starting off eating a nice pot brownie that I've been saving (Also for the first time, I'm getting high because it's enjoyable, not as an escape)


- Watch a movie (Never seen The Wolf of Wall Street and I think I'm going to try it out tonight)


- Watch TV shows (I've been watching The Office lately)


- Play a video game (I've been into Battlefield 1 and Civ 6 lately)


- Depending on how high I get, watch Planet Earth (On a more serious note, shit puts things into perspective and reminds you how fucking cool the planet where we live is. People might suck sometimes, but nature is beautiful as fuck. The colors and scenery are amazing but I'll probably be high as shit crying when I see the predator killed the prey only to bring the food back to its own babies)


- Fireworks get to me pretty badly, so if they get loud I'm going to put headphones in


- Limit social media use (I know I won't be able to stop myself from checking, so I'll just remind myself of what I typed earlier when I do)


- Eat good food (Try making something new or order out your favorite food)


- Give my dog a hug and a treat at midnight


- Get a good rest and wake up tomorrow like I do everyday

"Consider this post: ""Hello, I'm a 17 yo female high school senior.
So I have many problems, and I'm not going to point each of them out for the sake of keeping this post as short as possible.
I suffer from depression and loneliness and it's getting worse day by day.

Ever since I was in Kindergarten, I was always the odd one out. Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here.
Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.

I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.
All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. 

Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.

Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)

And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.

Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.

I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.
I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.
My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.

Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.
I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.

Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.
And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.

Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.

I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.

So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to bias or abuse.

"Consider this post: ""Recently I received some bad news at home — another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly.  I don’t want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my “luck” is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me.  My life is a story of waste: Brilliant, but not using that brain power at work; successful, but not enough to reach my goals.  Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way.  It drives me nuts, and feeds into the “black and white thinking” that plagues me.  So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether.  Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice.  He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else.  I’m thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills.  But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them.  I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year.  I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds.  I just needed to vent.  I feel like I have no one and nothing.

"Consider this post: ""I just left a happy but low paid job which I excelled at for one with better money and better prospects. But I absolutely hate it. I hate the thought of being there. I hate the thought of not being able to do the job. I hate how much more of my time it takes up despite only being contracted for two more hours than I was at my previous job.  
  
I understand that there comes nerves with a new start but I'm starting to wonder if it's all worth the effort if I was so much happier in my previous job, not just doing the work but it didn't invade my life with thoughts when I wasn't there. I have suffered from depression before, though not connected to work, and I can feel that the longer I am at my new job the less I'm enjoying my life. I've been absolutely miserable and unwanting to do anything in the past week. I don't know what to do. Any kind words would be greatly appreciated.""

Sorry, I know this sub helps people, I just feel it's way too late now plus i've never had much help in the past. I understand that I am damaged and unable to maintain friendships or show kindness. 

But I knew him for two years. He had just gotten out of one abusive relationship and into another. I was there both times. I assure you I didn't do to try to get with him. I didn't think i was capapble of love. But he liked me. He liked me for what I was. He didn't see this thin, blonde girl with scars. He saw something different.

But, he got back with his second ex who then abused him some more. She would cut if he wouldn't talk to her, laugh at his misfortunes. I was the one he went crying to every damn time. I was there when nobody else was.

They broke up, big suprise and he asked me out. I said yes and entered two happiest months of my life. Followed by the 4 most miserable months until he finally showed me mercy and dumped me.

He would constantly mock how skinny and pale I am. How my scars are easily noticeable, gee I never noticed. Laughed at my stories of abuse. But I loved him. I was stupid and I deserved to hurt. He would cut himself and encourage me to. I'm actually 7 months clean as of today but it's so hard not to go back.

Now he's back with his ex again. And I hope he suffers. Bad. I'm tired of being used. I'm tired of being a freak. Why was I born this way? Why am I hated so? Fine. I give up.

"Consider this post: ""
This summer I was very depressed after a break up and existential crisis. I ended up isolating myself in my room by not leaving often and my friend that stayed for the summer happens to be the one that loves belittling me, so they loved to see this. For some reason she is always so competitive and went out of her way to show that she had other friends and made fun of me for being in my room all the time. She was also the friend I was rooming with for the summer. I ended up failing my classes and taking the fall semester off because my depression became so bad. During the fall when I was at home I was fine, but now that im back at school all of the feelings came rushing back. I'm back at school by myself while my old friend group are probably getting together having fun somewhere. They didnt even contact me over the fall so i doubt that they care.

"Consider this post: ""I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

I have a feeling these past months thinking my dad will die soon. I feel it’s going to come and I won’t be able to make him happy. I can’t make him happy. I feel he’s been depressed for so long. I don’t know how to make him happy.  I have tried everyday to think about positive things and how I would make him happier, but I can’t. My mindset is not right because he makes the family (my mom and I) unhappy everyday. He is always grumpy and I don’t know how to cheer him up. He doesn’t want to do anything. I don’t feel like trying anymore.  

I know he’s dying soon. I am so sad because of it. I am so sad I don’t get to spend enough time with him to make him happy. I’m sad because I disappointed him for not working and wanting to study. He wanted me to work instead of study. But that logic is flawed. Because I need to finish school so I can get a better job. For him. But he’s dying. And that makes me so unmotivated to do anything.

"Consider this post: ""Kinda a long post. And I'm sorry. 

I've spent majority of my life following in other people's footsteps or following a path someone else created for me. I've never really been given the chance to create my own footsteps.. until now. 

For the last year and a half I've been with a guy let's call Christian. He was great. Honestly. We never fought. We never really got mad. We always talked things through. We always made sure that we understood each other.  And he understood me. He knew me so well. He knew when I was having an anxiety attack and he knew what to say to coax me out of it. He knew how to handle my depression. And honestly I could say that for the first time in my life I was happy. REALLY HAPPY. It honestly seemed too good to be true. And i guess looking back it was.

In Sept he left to school. It's an odd school where he's on a boat and only has service at ports.  So I could only really talk to him every couple of weeks and only if he found wifi. Well most of his ports are small towns in countries that it's harder to find wifi. You can imagine how hard this would be. But we were managing. We were trying.  And in november I went to Spain to go visit him and everything seemed normal. But About a month ago he out of the blue dumped me. It was over text. He had called me earlier that day telling me he missed me and that he loved me. Then a couple hours later I got a text that turned my whole world upside down. 

I feel like a total wreck. It was so unexpected that I still have a hard time believing it. He left for sea shortly after and I've spent the better part of this month trying to survive. And while everyone around me has been supper supportive, I've never felt more alone. All I want is Christian.  And I want him to make the hurt go away like he always does. But now it's my turn to make myself happy.  And i don't know how. 

He comes home for semester break in 4 days and I'm not handling it very well. I don't want him to come back because just the thought of him in the same town makes me spiral out of control. 

This is the first time that I'll be able to focus on me without ever thinking of someone else when I make decisions. While I should be happy because it's a new chapter... I'm starting school..  moved into my first home... I've never felt more alone and empty. And the only thing that's been getting me through my day and keeping me asleep at night is my constant supply of weed. 

I literally have to stay high all the time in order to make it through the day. I have a therapist. I have a family. But I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared to open up because once I do I'm afraid I'll never stop crying.  

The worst part is he asked to see me when he's home so we can give our stuff back to each other. And talk about moving on. But I've let myself go so badly that im embarassrd to see him. I've gained over 20 pounds since I saw him in november. I don't want him to know I'm suffering. Or to know I'm dying on the onside.  But he will know as soon as he sees me. I'm an emotional eater. 

I'm scared. I'm lost. And I don't know how to move on. I just need someone to tell me that im going to be okay. 

Tldr; my boyfriend dumped my ass leaving me feeling alone and unsure of how to find myself and heal.

"Consider this post: ""Depression it’s a bitch.
Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don’t deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you’ve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. 
You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn’t good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. 
All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out.

"Consider this post: ""Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.

I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere.

The response I get from my family ""Suck it up, we've all been there"". 

I took a long hard fucking look at them, none of them are happy. They're just permanently angry. They're angry at people who have it better, yeah sometimes someone else gets lucky, but they're always just fucking resentful, never supportive. They think they're so much better, if they're better why are they angry? Why are they constantly complaining? If they're better than their managers, their bosses, their peers who got a promotion or the neighbours that have a stable family, why are they the ones with the loveless marriage, the ones that are passed up for promotions? 

They get fucking angry when I take time off for mental illness, ""If you're not in a mental hospital you're well enough to go to work"". Knowing them if I did go back to the psych ward they'd probably berate me for stealing money off of the NHS. I'd be open to them having issues that need to be worked out too, but I have no sympathy for them if they're gonna shit on other mentally ill folk instead of fixing themselves.

"Consider this post: ""Friends,

On a throwaway here for now. I had to write/speak to someone so I've decided here is the best place. 

With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience.

A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing!

Now I'm desperately struggling to keep happy and I have this low to medium level of anxiety that just won't go away no matter how hard I try and think differently. I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home. The annoying thing is, 6 months ago, I wouldn't care less about being away from home! Or spending time alone!

How do I go about just getting my resilience back and being able to deal with things? I wish wish wish I could be like, oh, so I have to fly out on Monday, big deal, I'll be back soon, make the most of it!

I just want this anxiety to go away and leave me in peace!

"Consider this post: ""Here we are again, in the middle of the night with nothing but the thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future. I've been here so often over the last 10 years it feels like home. And has it really been 10 years? Unfortunately, yes. 10 years of depression. 10 years of anxiety issues interfering with my daily life. 5 Years out of high school and all I can count is the number of things I've fucked up. Dropped out of college. Been through 6 under-paid jobs that had me working 12 or more hours a day to exhaustion and panic attacks. That one really kills me. For the longest time panic attacks weren't something I had to worry about. I had maybe 3 from age 13 to 18. Then retail happened to me and I started having one a month. Then it turned into 1 a week. Then it turned into having problems leaving my house and jumping at the sound of a car starting. I suppose I've worked through part of that. I don't jump at everything anymore, and I managed to get out of the house some but being in public for any extended period of time still makes me nervous. I ran out of friends somewhere 2 years ago when I realized that my entire friend-group only hung around because I was a convenient source for weed and car rides. The last roomates I had were more my children than friends, since I had to constantly pick up after them to keep some organization in my living space, and constantly woke me up in the middle of the night bringing groups of drunk people over. I went straight after that. No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I still miss smoking. It gave me some amount of comfort in hard times, but you can't keep doing a thing that's killing you. Or so they say. I still have the urge to live, otherwise I would have kept the habit even when I started coughing up blood most mornings.
But the period of severe anxiety and depression before I did give up everything drained what meager savings I had accumulated. I was so afraid to leave the house that I quit my job, ordered delivery every day, and tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed. There went 2k in a matter of months. What a waste. I could have bought into Bitcoin with that money. 
My mom had recently moved back into the state. I had no idea until she showed up on my doorstep every other day when my phone service went out. She helped me get out of the shit house I was staying in, gave me a place to stay and food for the last month, but I can tell her patience is running thin. In the beginning it was all ""OMG let me help you!"" ""We'll take you to a therapist"". That lasted all of a week before it was on to the same drivel I got growing up about getting a job. Meanwhile, I can't get even get McDonald's to call me back anymore. -.- I don't really think I need to talk to a therapist. Drugs aren't going to improve my situation all that much. Getting a call back from even the lowest of the pizza delivery places around here would help. A lack of inflation driving school tuitions and hence my student loans sky high would help. But drugs? I doubt it. If the drugs that helped me decide to STOP doing drugs didn't help, then the one's to dull my mind and make me ok with slaving for 12 hours a day on a wage that won't pay for an apartment without room-mates sure as hell aren't. But that comes too close to playing the victim for comfort. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want sympathy, I just want to do something productive that makes me not feel like shit, and lets me afford my own space. Does that sound like too much to ask? Really, someone should tell me because from my POV it doesn't, but I may not be thinking in the clearest terms anymore. My experiences of the last 5 years certainly seem to point in this direction. But whatever the case may be, thanks for reading, if you have. It's a release of some sort to put my thoughts down on paper.""

"Consider this post: ""So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth.

It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. 

Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. 

If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go.

My dad ended up getting upset that there's ""always something wrong with me.""

Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has.

Today my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about ""why don't I do x or y"" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. 

And then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself.

"Consider this post: ""Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples.

At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. 

When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. 

There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one.

I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades.

Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. 

I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood.

I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none.

I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool. 

I forget my families birthdays.

I forget basic mathmatics.

I forget my address.

I forget my phone number.

I forget my passions.

I forget my dreams.

I even forget my age.

I thought my cat was 1, turns out after my sister laughed for 15 minutes she told me he was 3.

I love my cat.

I've had dozens of people in my life tell me I'm stupid. I get bullied because of my memory loss. I get called mental almost every day. my closest friends think I am an idiot. My teachers, my parents, all of my loved ones, etc think I am stupid.

I told my father this. I started crying in front of him and you know what he told me?

You don't listen.

I have not visited a doctor because my dad doesn't believe me.

I'm not a person to talk about my feelings, since it mostly worsen my depression. Like it does now. I feel so bad, but I pretend like I don't remember infront of the others.

My friends think it was the alcohol, I guess. But it was just a side-effect, comparing to the true reason, which is, that 2017 was one of my worse years by now. I always thought, it will get better, I can stand this and become better at controlling it. But I haven't calculated failure and so I'm thrown back years.

"Consider this post: ""Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. 

I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to.

Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic.  I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow.  At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. 

My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design.  Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do,  sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways.  I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side,  which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking.

I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. 

I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough)  movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability.  But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail,  that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. 

Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life,  that I cant really live life at all.  So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking  day? 

I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family.  Even then,  Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways.  But Ive been thinking about it more often lately

I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now.

"Consider this post: ""I've never opened up before like this before so please forgive the incoming wall of text

My girlfriend broke up with me a couple of months ago. We're still friends, but I can't stop thinking about her and regretting letting it happen. She is what I think about most of the day, and I am on the verge of coming back crying to her asking her to forgive me and give me another chance. She was the only one that cared about me, that didn't put me down. Even though I had many failings she still said she loved me, even after my best friend's put me down for being dumb. She was the only one that treated me as an equal and not a second rate citizen to be laughed at or to be disappointed with. 

I started uni this year. I've had fun but made close to no friends and it feels really superficial. I don't know if I like it but there's no way I can go back now, my parents will fucking disown me even if I try, even though I'm at a second rate uni wasting my time. The people I talk to most are still my friends from school and my now ex. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I am never happy. I tried getting help from my email by applying for councilling but they took a month to reply and when I turned up there was no one there. 

I am so lonely. I have no more will to continue. I can't end it but if I could I would. The weather makes me feel like shit. The success of all my friends compared to how much of a fucking FAILURE I am makes me feel like shit. I have no one to turn to. Most nights I can't even sleep and when I do only for a few hours at a time. I will do shit in my exams. I still go through life but I feel like an empty vessel. My parents are disappointed in me. My younger sister makes fun of me. People avoid me.

I try to be an interesting person and someone to invite to parties but it just seems whatever I do people reject me. I just want this to end. I want to be happy and live life. This is meant to be the best time of my life, so why is the best thing in my life the fact that I got a decent amount of karma on a post on my main?

"Consider this post: ""Is... Is this really a thing? Another post recently had a reply pointing this out as a possibility of being a thing.

 My life isn't bad. It's not great, I'm not homeless and I have food and a roof... But I just feel like everything is wrong so often. If left to my own thoughts I sit and dwell on all I;m done wrong, how I may have upset people that day, do people actually care? Am I being manipulated for their gain and it's all fake 'love' towards me? 

I don't know what's wrong. I sit and cry for no reason just because nothing feels correct or right, but I don't know what's wrong about it. I'm afraid of upsetting people so I always shrink back at conflict. I'm afraid of seeming too needy so I never tell people when something is wrong. 


I have someone I care about, but I'm so afraid of burdening them with more problems about myself, when they have their own stuff to deal with anyway. It's not a... 'relationship' in the common use of the word, but someone that is important to me, so I don't feel I have the right to pester them or drag them down. And what would I tell them anyway? ""I'm uspet because nothing is right, but I don't know what right is, so I don't even know it's wrong anyway?"" That doesn't work... 


I'm not suicidal. I have no right to be. I don't think I have half the problems those that stand on that cliff must have in their life, so how could I possibly consider doing that? I just want to sleep so much. When I'm asleep I don't think, I don't dwell on how I feel. 


It's so dumb. I worry over even stupid stuff in video games with friends. I switched servers in a game recently, and I still contact and talk to all the people from the old server, but I still felt sick as I did it. I sat and cried over slighting those that I left behind on the old server, because I left them behind. 


Is this dumb shit I sit and think and do Depression? These thoughts of being worth nothing, thoughts that I'm hurting everyone around me by existing, forcing them to interact with me like I'm the unwanted little brother of your best friend that his mom forced him to bring along to play with. 


But now I have to wonder if I just manufacture all this myself. Make myself feel negative about myself to get... whatever I get out of that. Loop it around, driving myself more and more downward.


I dunno why I posted this really. Maybe I just want people to at least see that I'm not all there. I tried so hard to hide that from those I care about, that maybe nobody knew something was wrong for the longest time. So... Thanks for reading this.""

"Consider this post: ""I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.

Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.

Some health problems I have are:
 I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.

things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:
I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.
For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.

I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.

I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  

The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  

I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.

A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.

I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.  

Any help is greatly appreciated. "" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to jobs and career.

It does not mention any specific circumstances such as bias or abuse, job or career issues, medication, relationships, or alienation that could be contributing factors. Thus, the assigned label is ""None""."
"Consider this post: ""I'm currently going through some hard times and have no emotion towards it.

Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only  logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent.

They discuss being removed from school due to their condition and feeling as though they have been frozen in time while the rest of the world continues moving forward. This sense of isolation and lack of progress can be contributing to their mental disorders. They also mention going through depression initially but now feeling a lack of emotions, including empathy towards others.

"Consider this post: ""I’m tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it’s kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She’s not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I’d never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she’s the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn’t go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was “That’s not good,” and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I’ve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it’ll stop hurting so much. What’s even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master’s degree. She’s very school smart and has always done very well. I’m going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I’m going to support her but I’m afraid I’m just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I’m so scared I’m going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She’s so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she’s just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I’ve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I’ve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I’ve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can’t get excited for them or feel anything at all.

"Consider this post: ""Hi everyone I'm new to this sub but I just need some help with my change.

Recently I found myself in a really positive relationship and because I love my boyfriend, I agreed to give him my blades and he promised he would keep them out of reach. I did this because I feel okay knowing they still exist even if I can't get to them. I could never get myself to throw them away.

But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury.

They also mention being in a new relationship and giving their blades to their boyfriend as a means of trying to stop self-harming. However, they are now experiencing increased depression and a lack of alternative coping mechanisms. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorder is related to their relationship, as the change in their self-harming behavior and reliance on their partner for support has not effectively addressed their underlying emotional struggles."

"Consider this post: ""I’d like to preface this post by saying if it appears that I am trolling, I am not, but I realise some of these points may seem illegitimate. 

I watched frozen for the first time recently. Being a 20 year old man, I realised I wasn’t in the target audience for it, but I watched it nonetheless as I had nothin better to do. As I watched it I found myself strangely entranced. I enjoyed this innocence of it but it was strangely alien to me, like I’d never experienced something like it before. It got me thinking about my childhood, which I’ve not long departed, and yet have rarely reflected upon.

I thought about how alien frozen was to me, and how I lacked anything like it when I was growing up. I was never shown Disney or Pixar films in my infancy, unlike, dare I say, most people my age. I summed this up to spending very little time with my mother due to her illnesses that rendered her incapable of caring for me in my formative years. Instead, I spent them in the care of my grandparents, who were very kind to me, yet it was not the same as having parents as my friends did. It wasn’t until I was around 13 or 14 when my mother took over full time care of me, by which time it was too late for me to gather the classically happy childhood memories I feel I’m lacking. Even when she took over my care, she was not really the perfect mother, not for lack of trying but due to a lack of experience, (she had me when she was very young compared to the average). She couldn’t afford to rent a particularly nice place to stay, in fact it was so run down that I was too embarrassed to invite friends over. Sometimes she invited friends for me by asking their parents, but I soon put a stop to that when I discovered they’d been talking about my house behind my back, commenting on how grotty it was compared to their middle class mansions in the suburbs. Times got so bad that, on multiple occasions, I remember being told to get on the floor and to be quiet whilst debt collectors hammered on the door in search of our meagre possessions to settle debts for necessities like electricity and gas.

I never knew my father either, in fact I didn’t even know his name until about 2 years ago, when I found it out from my birth certificate. I then googled it and discovered he was a convicted paedophile which sent me into a downward spiral of self identity crisis. I always felt this lack of knowledge of where I come from. Friends who didn’t understand would often ask me if I missed my dad or not and bullies who found out the information would often use it to their advantage.

I guess all in all what I’m trying to say is I feel unsatisfied with my childhood, but I was never abused, verbally or physically. I was never homeless or reliant on food banks, despite being close on several occasions. I was always taught to be grateful for what I have. Like that classic quote says, “If you have running water and a refrigerator, you’re better off than half of the worlds population.” I’ve always hated lines like that, I’ve certainly never felt better off, and even less so when compared to my peers. I quote that comes to mind is “I never wanted more than everyone else, just not the less I was used to.” I don’t know if I’m being melodramatic or if I have legitimate reasons to feel cheated. I guess I’m just struggling with moving past darker days right now...

Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's dissatisfaction with their childhood and feelings of being cheated in comparison to their peers. They mention being raised by their grandparents instead of their mother, experiencing financial difficulties, living in a run-down house, being embarrassed to invite friends over, and receiving comments from others about their living situation. The post also talks about the lack of knowledge about their father and discovering his criminal history, which led to a self-identity crisis.

"Consider this post: ""So this girl and I have been talking a while and I slowly started liking her more, I have extreme emotions and the only one I learned to control was anger so my other ones go Willy nilly, I haven't been diagnosed because they don't know what to diagnose it as. She started off by giving very blatant signals, so we started being flirty etc I asked her out and the date is in a few days, she was my +1 to a new year's party and we cuddled most of the time and kissed and as she left I walked her to the car. Then I talked to her yesterday morning  and I haven't talked to her since but she has seen my message. I know I'm overreacting and over thinking but I can't get over all my stress and anxiety about it, I realize it's likely nothing but I'm very stressed out.

"Consider this post: ""I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now.

You see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. 

For example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to medication.

"Consider this post: ""Recently I got together with my long time on and off close guy friend from high school. We hadn't talked in over half a year because I blocked him due to the fact that I felt he was constantly leading me on. A couple of months ago he found a way to reach out to me and I ended up calling him and we met up. I ended up kissing him, which is not my nature because I would like to wait till marriage to do anything sexual. Kissing is not too much of a big deal for me but it is something special. I began talking to him again and we would hang out and kiss. I had an emotional breakdown in front of him at one point and that is when I realized that I really liked him. I decided it was time for us to have a talk about where our relationship was going because I had many boundaries and he had many expectations that crossed those boundaries. I finally had a talk with him where he didn't take me very seriously and constantly made jokes about sex and how that's what he wanted from me, till I realized he wasn't merely joking, the things he said had a lot of truth to them. I felt very stupid for being so oblivious to the fact that this man that I have known since high school was such a dirt bag. I ended up leaving his car mid conversation because he wasn't taking me seriously and we haven't really talked since. The following day I felt so liberated. I never felt so happy in my entire life. I realized that I deserved much better but the issue is, I never seem to give that to myself. Despite feeling pretty great about my crappy fling ending, I feel like a part of me is upset. I always end up grieving over people who didn't really try with me and for some reason I don't care this time. For some reason, I want him to see what he missed out on. I know he and I are on different wavelengths, I understand that. I just feel like he lost someone who could've given him real love and care, someone who would've fed his mind. He and I clicked, we had nothing in common but we clicked. He has never been involved with a girl like me, someone willing to feed his soul instead of his body. Sometimes he would make fun of me, call me a ""12 year old girl"" because my idea of a relationship doesn't include sex. I feel like nobody will date me because of this matter, though I know I'm beautiful and hold many admirable characteristics. I feel like this is all buzzing in my head and bringing me down. The fact that I am so underappreciated at times. I do it to myself. I wish I could stop.

Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great.

Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though.

She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation.

She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer.

I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about.

Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of self-hatred, anxiety, and a sense of being useless. The poster also mentions getting easily distracted by their own thoughts and causing financial issues.

"Consider this post: ""I'm not really sure if this is the place to post this, but it shouldn't really matter as it truly upsets me anyways.

Honestly, I've got to be one of the unluckiest people ever. It's coming to be really stupid and upsetting how unlucky I am.

My dad always told me in order for you to be happy, you must be positive. You need to do good things for other people. You need to be a good person. So, I decided to change who I am. 

Over the course of the last three years I've donated to several charities, I've helped in food drives, and much more. When I went to Africa a few years ago, I gave away several supplies and food to less fortunate families living on the beach. Every year, on holidays, if I'm doing something such as getting my haircut, I'll give them a pretty generous tip. (~$20 tip on a $14 haircut)

I used to run a depression help and therapy sessions for people who wanted to end their lives. I've met amazing people and helped many people get past their biggest fears/ problems. Don't get me wrong or anything, I'm very thankful for those experiences and friends I've made.

But really, the last three years of my life have also been the worst time of my life. I lost my first true love. A five year LDR, and we'd finally met in the fourth year. But ya know, of course, she ended up cheating on me with her best guy friend, that I told her I was worried about losing her to. ?\_(ツ)_/? FML. 

I just started college this year, got very close to my roommates. Felt very fortunate for the new friends I had made. Halfway through the year, we realized that one of our roommates had been stealing our shatter (for dabbing. thc concentrate). Which has account for more than $300 total. He also stole my friends juul (an e-cig), he won't admit to it and of course wouldn't buy him a new one and/ or give it back. The other roommate is very stingy with money, so of course, the generous person I am, I bought him a new one. Mind you I already bought him new juul pods (juice refills) a week prior, because I felt like I wanted to contribute and help him pay for it, since I've used it a few times before. 

This winter break my roommate, the one who owned the juul, let me take it home with me. Of course, at the end of the trip, flying home, I stuck it in my front right pocket and somehow it ended up gone. I always check the seat pocket in front of me and my seat after flying. So, yeah, I'm going to buy him another one. 

Realistically, the money isn't that big of a deal. I mean, I am a college student and my bank account is going down, down, down. However, it's really starting to get to me with all this negative-luck. Honestly, in the past i've wanted to kill myself, and with my luck, I wouldn't doubt I'd accidentally kill myself. 

I don't know how to get this shit to stop, but it's really starting to get to me. I don't understand how I can be a pretty good person, and be so goddamn unlucky; while people like my sister, who are complete assholes, do nothing but strive. 

??????"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship.

These experiences have had a significant impact on the poster's mental well-being, as they mention feeling unlucky and have had thoughts of suicide in the past. The negative experiences in relationships and the feeling of being unfairly treated compared to others suggest that relationship issues are the cause of their mental disorders."

All my friends were partying it up and having fun without me! I was so fucking pissed off and sad.

"Consider this post: ""I've recently had a bad break up. I was dating a really great girl but she dumped me. We were really close friends after we broke up and even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything because she didnt want to get back together with me. Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle and into some ambiguous territory where she can talk to me from time to time (Nowhere as frequent as before) about random shit, none of it personal and deep like it used to be. She doesnt trust me anymore. I know Im supposed to move on from my ex after Im dumped, especially if Im still in love with her, but I dont have any close friends and my ex was my best friend when we dated too. I tried to go on without her for a while when she ghosted me, but I was in the darkest place I had ever been in, I literally was so close to attempting, since then I've reached back out to her and I've reached a state where unlike before, I can live life, but I have a very strong urge I will never be happy because she will never be with me again. 

So we've been talking again for a day or two, a month ago, if she was active she would literally be texting me, she would tell me anything and everything, and that brought so much joy to my life. But now she'll talk to me about some random shit every few hours, seening my all the time like she doesnt really wanna let me in. But honestly, its better this way for my mental health than not talking to her at all. She often expresses how ""I still mean a lot to her"".

I know through some sources that shes started to click with some other guy like we used when we first started dating and Im honestly so close to a fucking mental break down. Just the idea of her moving on already is like a fucking dagger through the heart, but if I stop talking to this girl I lose myself entirely right now. I dont know what to do, one of my friends died last night and that has put me in an even worse place than before. I would usually talk to my ex about it but shes pointed out (and its true) that I had a phase where I would go to her and seek attention and support and shes tired of it. I know shes right because it was an extremely narcissistic phase and It was definitely my bad. Anyway, I dont really know what to do, I havent cried in a few days but I think I will today.""

"Consider this post: ""*wave*

I'm unsure where to even begin..

It's almost 2017. I'm 22 years old. I wake up every morning and regret the first and last breath of every moment from then until sleep carries me away, back into a dream world where my problems don't exist..

I'm struggling with things.. My memories just feel like I'm looking at a glimpse of somebody elses past.. I can't even focus on time accurately anymore. Everything seems to blend into one at times to the point that it's hard to recall whether things happened one day or another.. 

I have no purpose, no meaning in life, outside of living for my family. That's the one saving grace, I'd be long gone if they weren't around. But.. the longer this goes on the more I question the futility of living this way.. Selfish springs to mind, I would rip through their lives and leave an unfillable hole if I ever managed to muster the courage and end it all.

On top of this mental nightmare, I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. I've managed to be trapped in a life where work is the only social activity I partake in.. I play video games occasionally, but always alone. Socially, I'm inert. I can't help but feel if I had more friends and some semblance of a social life, my problems would be alleviated slightly.. but I've tried to no avail. I struggle with making friends, more-so any good ones. I can only reminisce of the times before I pushed them all away it would seem.

I feel the longer I stay here the further I drift ever closer to the end.. Looking for a job to no avail, the added failure stacking more onto an already miserable existence.

Don't get me wrong, suicide clearly isn't the ideal situation. Even I understand that there are bound to be things in life I enjoy, love even, that I've never even experienced.. but one person can only take so much before they snap. Even if it's in the pursuit of happiness.

People outside of this debilitating illness don't understand. I'm not sure many of them ever will. If I was asked ""Do you want to die?"" It's an easy no. Well why then? Because I'm tired of the crying, I'm tired of spending days in bed forcing myself to eat to avoid ending up back in the hospital.. There are no words that accurately definitively say what I feel, none that would provide the insight so many need to understand this shit. I'm at a point sometimes where I want to end it just to illustrate how I actually feel.. So people will finally understand.. Actions speak louder than words after all.

Time will tell where I end up. As I write this, seeing my life outlined like this, I can't work out if I feel validated or like I've just sunk even further into the abyss..

I didn't anticipate writing so much, it wrote itself mostly..

Sorry if it bore any of you, I needed to speak and this is one of the few subreddits where I didn't think I would be judged.

I used to live with her and just moved out due to me needing a closer house to my job so now I live with B. I've been struggling with depression most of my life but I hadn't really accepted it. To me I was raised that being depressed or bipolar or whatever is just an excuse and that I should just be normal. I have a habit of just eating everything so B confronts me about it when we go to Wal-Mart. Makes a huge lecture in the car about how ""I'm eating everything and what is wrong with me"". She's not lying so I just start thinking, *is this really how my life is going?* On the drive home, I was quiet and A took notice but dismissed it. This was two days ago.

Earlier at A's house, A and I were in the kitchen and I started talking about how I felt. B was at work. Then the conversation went to me talking about what made me sad. How I feel like I suck the joy out of others. And how I saw a video about how one guy wanted to end it, so he's basically just eating himself to death. I told her that I feel like maybe I'm doing that too.... Eating to fill a void.... I told her how I miss my family (I moved out of my dads house and he's on the other side of the country so I can't just go down the street) and how I just am generally sad, dropping out of college, etc. How eating makes me forget how I feel and I feel at peace. How I'm too scared to actually do anything so I feel like I might just be letting nature take its course. 

Her face scared me. I never have told anyone about how I felt, except for y'all. (I post sometimes.) Her face just looked like I had told her I murdered puppies or something. Part of me hated that I told her, that I was weak. But another part, and the reason I post this, feels free. I feel good that someone knows. I don't feel alone. 

She's gonna help me lose weight and focus on music to try to find something meaningful in life. I feel good. I accept that I do suffer from depression. I was diagnosed before but as I said I didn't take it seriously.

This indicates a potential bias or lack of understanding surrounding mental health within their family. 

The post also discusses the poster's habit of overeating and how it is confronted by their cousin B. This may be a coping mechanism for dealing with their emotions and filling a void, suggesting a potential relationship between their depression and their eating habits.

"Consider this post: ""Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because ""it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful"" or because I was terrified of being around people.

I tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually.

Next I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA.

So I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state).

Adding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August.

Since then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description.

The worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left.

I have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless.

"Consider this post: ""I'm making this post just to vent mainly. Here's some stuff about me:

I am a mid 20s male. I make good money, enough to save half of it and probably retire early. I have a great girlfriend that is an absolute blessing in my life. I'm decently in shape and used to be a bodybuilder but that kind of slipped away. I'm a smart person, always in the top 15% of whatever academic class. Great parents that support me. It all started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed. Later I learned that most people get depressed in grad school because it's such a shitty prospect. It has been 1.5 years since I decided to dropout from a PhD and I'm still fucking livid about how shitty it was. Like I can't move my life past it. Now my job is mostly boring and easy but pays way better.

Now here I am 2 years later and still depressed. It's just like I am watching my life fall apart in front of my very eyes unable to do anything about it. But that's the thing, I have it so good that I can't even let my life fall apart. One person told me I couldn't fail if I tried and it's like I'm trying to prove him wrong. It's like I'm trying to fail but I just can't. And I think that contributes to the helpless feeling. At the heart of my depression is just the hopelessness and lack of control that kills me. I want to feel like I'm in some sort of control over my life but it feels like no matter what I do, hard work, lazy, focus on this or that, it just feels like it doesn't matter either way. That takes all of the fun out of life for me. It feels like life turned from a choose-your-own-adventure to a roller coaster ride with a fixed track. No way to get off the ride, just have to take the shit that comes along. I'm slowly giving up all the passions I used to have because I'm either not good enough or I'm worse at stuff than I used to be. I long to be like the 21 year old version of myself. I was so happy then.

But I'm so confused because right now I live with a guy who is fat, eats unhealthy, doesn't have many friends, is annoying, no college degree, never moved out of this area. Just generally a nerd with little social skills. But he seems to be happy. And I'm so confused. How can I have so much more going for me but be miserable? I just want this to end. I want to just be satisfied and happy with my life but I can't find anything that will scratch that itch. I'm just existing and the only thing I'm looking forward to is getting a dog, retiring early, and getting married. Those are pretty cool things, but it just feels like brain is so fucked that I won't be able to enjoy it. I smoke weed (not all the time) to cope and it helps, but really just delays these feelings like I'm having now. Fuck.""

"Consider this post: ""I have suffered from depression my entire life. About a year ago it was at its worst. I went to a mental hospital, got an appropriate diagnosis and medicine. It was the best thing I ever did, but why am I still suffering a year later. 
Things I did right: 
Got sober (11 months) 
Gave up pot (only 2 days) 
Going to AA daily.
Going to therapy weekly. 
Taking meds.
Sleeping every night.
eating better (like every day) 
Went low-contact with narcissistic mother (moved out of her house) 
Got a REALLY good new job. 
Got a physical, getting blood work back soon, she thinks I am low in B12 and D
Broke up with boyfriend.  
Things I am struggling with: 
Still very low energy.
not working out.
not cooking, not eating that well, but better.
not drinking water.
hopeless.
I beat myself up daily.
Is this as good as it gets.

My psychiatrist seems happy that I am doing so much better than I was, but really, is this as good as it gets? I am glad I have removed the toxic people (mother, bf) and a bad job, from my life. But I haven't refilled it with new people. I am meeting new people at AA. I am uncovering a lot of abuse I suffered, but was unaware of. Turning up a lot of sadness. It's hard connecting with others.

I keep searching for meaning or being able to feel SOMETHING, literally anything but this blah-ness that encompasses everything I do. I drink, I go out, I go on rollar coasters, I run away for a month and nothing changes. Everything still feels like nothing. I'm empty. The only time I feel alive is when I'm playing video games because then I'm not me, I'm doing something totally abnormal. But my life is meaningless. There is not light, no happiness.

If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless.

My parents love me, unconditionally, they want the best for me, they have sacrificed a lot for me to come to where I am now, I got a high score in my final exams and I want to become a politician, but my parents won't let me because of the ""sins"" that will be committed, I am religious, the reason I want to become a politician is because my native culture is DYING in my country, the my culture is part of the majority ethnic group, our ethnic group's culture is being wiped off, the government stopped teaching my country's history so children become less patriotic, the police are corrupted, and many more atrocities are committed by the government.

It is my dream, but if I ditch my parents I would want to kill myself, I would not be able to hold in the guilt. My dad also believes that if the elders of the party order you to do something and you don't do it, because it is not moral or just plain stupid,they will kick you off the party, can't I just create my own party?

"Consider this post: ""Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.

We've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.

This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. 

After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. 

She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.

Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I ""was never there for her"" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more ""fucked up"" than she is and I don't even realize it. 

I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members.

I just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her.

"Consider this post: ""Every time I type something up here I think of all the times I've been psychologically tortured by ""friends"" and just people online to the point of it being more harmful than my own mental illnesses that I get scared.

Tonight I'm not scared.

It's been tough since November. TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism?

I thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital.

I don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening.

I don't know what the hell I want out of posting here, I've just found myself at this sub reddit more and more and I guess tonight I needed to get this off of my chest. Lord knows if I do it on FB someone will call the police again for a wellness check (despite knowing I 1) have a safety plan with my therapist I see weekly and 2) have been known IN THE PAST to get myself to the psych ER when I'm feeling low enough) or accuse me of drama or something else.

I don't know. Fuck the holidays, fuck new years and I wish I had friends who cared. Everyone I've ever tried to meet online or in any of my games either turned out to be transphobic, homophobic and absolutely psychotic the second I refused their advances. I just want fucking conversation where someone's end game isn't to get laid (I'm asexual so good luck bruh) or treat me like a piece of shit.""

"Consider this post: ""I posted about an hour ago in r/relationships about a situation with my roommate where he owes me $1000 in unpaid debt, and I told his mom about it when she came to visit.

Most people sided with me, and told me I was right to do what I did. This was a great boost of confidence, and I finally felt certainty in my actions after all the apprehension I've felt while dealing with my roommate's failure to pay his bills. 

Tonight, I decided to tell my Mom, Dad, and sister about my decision, certain that they would finally side with me and praise me for doing the right thing, and being assertive. I know that in the past they have sympathized with my roommate, but I wanted them to see once and for all that I'm not the bad guy for wanting to take him to court, or to tell his parents about the massive debt that he owes me.

Their reactions were...not good.

My mom buried her face in her hand and said, ""You *really* shouldn't have done that.""

My Dad fell silent, and didn't say anything. He had a look on his face that said, ""You fucked up"", though.

I started rattling off stuff that people told me on Reddit about how right this decision was, and how I'm doing the right thing, about how great it was that I was finally taking action, etc.

My sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations! Getting validation from strangers on the internet really makes you confident in yourself, huh?""

Why doesn't she see how right I am? This whole situation with my roommate is cut-and-dry, and I'm taking the necessary steps to fix it. 

I started reciting some of the answers I got (they were really well-written), but the more I spoke, the more angrier they got, until my sister's eyes bore into me like daggers, and my Mom was sort of just standing there laughing, in an exhausted kind of way. ""There's no going back now."" she said in a defeated tone of voice. ""What's done is done. You let random internet people tell you what to do instead of us, and you're going to feel the consequences of that decision very soon.""

My voice cracked a little as I desperately tried to convince them to side with me, until Dad said, ""That's enough. We're not talking about this anymore. You're making your Mom upset.""

Why can't my family just be proud of me? I'm clearly, *clearly* doing the right thing here, and yet my parents seem to be more concerned about preserving the peace with my deadbeat roommate than getting my money back. Their *son's* money! I'm the one they should feel sorry for, not him.

A lot of people in that Reddit thread told me that I care way too much about what my family thinks, and I agree whole-heartedly. I don't know how to stop caring about what they think, because right now, they're all I've got. I don't really have any good friends who will talk to me about life situations without tuning out, or ignoring me. I've never dealt with difficult life situations like this before, and I need all the support I can get. I try to do all the right things, all the time, and I can't please them or make them happy. Nothing is ever good enough. I apologize if I sound dramatic, but these emotions have a firm hold on me and I can't make them stop. 

I want people to know how much my parent's disapproval means to me. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I might need some advice on how to stop caring what they think, because tonight, I felt like I *needed* them to tell me that I made the right decision, because I will be dealing with a pissed-off roommate for two months, and it would really help to have people in my corner to tell me that I'm not the bad person that my roommate is making me out to be.""

"Consider this post: ""Hi all.
This is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far).
I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going.""

I start college in two weeks, and now I won't have a paycheck coming every week, but I can't bring myself to care all that much. I noticed I've been much more reckless when driving by myself lately, too. I almost got T boned after leaving the library yesterday and felt nothing. No fear. Just nothing. 

I wish I could work at the library, it's usually quiet around there...
"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to jobs and career. Reasoning: The post clearly states that the poster is experiencing distress and dissatisfaction related to their job. They mention being moved to a department they can't stand, having their hours changed, and feeling trapped in a job they dislike. The poster also mentions lying about going to work and instead spending time at the library reading books on mental illness, indicating a negative impact on their mental well-being due to their job.

"Consider this post: ""All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen.

This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. 

That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. 

It's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Fuck everything. "" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of struggling to fit in, stress, anxiety, and depression, which suggests pre-existing mental health issues. However, the focus of the post is on the poster's relationship with a girl who they describe as their first meaningful romantic connection. They mention that this relationship brought them hope and happiness, but after the girl attempted suicide, their relationship changed drastically. The girl pushes the poster away, dumps them, and has a negative outlook on life. This sudden change in the relationship and the girl's mental state is causing distress for the poster and exacerbating their own mental health issues. Therefore, the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the tumultuous relationship and the emotional impact of the girl's mental health struggles."

That something being music, specifically Metal and Dungeon Synth. I've also gathered a bit of energy and motivation and can hopefully use that to lose weight and learn some instruments. Hopefully things stay this way, because I'm still a sad fuck and any little thing can send me back to where I was a couple nights ago.

"Consider this post: ""
I have been having some things happen to me which I think might be related to depression. The only thing is that I am not sad and don’t have self confidence problems either, but have some other things which sound like depression.

I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don’t feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can’t hear it), and sometimes I don’t make any facial expressions so people think that I don’t like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don’t want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like “do it, stab them in the neck” or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can’t put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me “are you ok?” This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can’t remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.


TLDR: I think something is changed with me

"Consider this post: ""23F here. I have depression that comes in waves, and then recedes after maybe 6-9 months, with no warning and for no apparent reason. This has been going on since I was 18.

During these lows, I get suicidally depressed. I see the world through an incredibly negative filter until nothing seems to matter much at all. I often doubt that reality is even real sometimes, I feel so detached.

Since nothing matters and I kinda plan on maybe killing myself soon anyway, I tend to lose my inhibitions. I tend to feel so much pain that I can't expend energy pretending to be happy or living up to society's expectations. Nothing matters, and Devin's a prick, so I'm going to tell Devin he's a prick, consequences be damned! 

My depression is receding again and I am cringing at the things I did when life seemed to have no purpose. I am now having to pick up the pieces of what I destroyed in my depressive period- I'm a straight A student outside of these lows, but fail most classes during them. Next semester I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's, but I'm going to have to work hard to make up for lost time to even get above a 2.0.

Over the last few months I have cried in public, at work...I have snapped at people- depression tends to make me extremely mean. I always suspect people hate me and have bad intentions...my own grandmother, an angel on Earth, took me shopping, and I was totally pissy the entire time. This is partially because depression makes me feel physically horrible, exhausted and headache ridden constantly, but I still feel like an awful person.

While not depressed, I drink like a sane person. While depressed, I give up on moderation completely and drink as much as I want whenever I want. Tuesday at noon? Let's get blackout drunk! There is no God anyway!

Yeah, I showed up at Thanksgiving very visibly hammered, to dinner with my extended, religious family that doesn't drink. Before my depression started to melt, I just shrugged at how horrifyingly taboo this is. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME? I'M BEYOND HOPE ANYWAY!!! HATE ME LIKE YOU ALREADY DO!!!

Yeah, my lows are VERY low.

Now I'm back to the outgoing, relatively high achieving, sane human being that I am half of the time and it's like waking up the morning after drinking realizing how horrible and embarrassing all of your actions the night before were.

Am I the only one who has experienced this?"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to medication.

Monday through Friday it's Wake up, bathe, dress, eat. Drive an hour in backed up traffic to get to the job responsible for this life sucking routine...Shit, I'm 10 minutes late. Boss is gonna threaten my lively hood for such a simple mistake.    

""Stop crying, at least you get paid. You should be grateful for those hours and all that money you made"".

I'm looking at the clock and its 2:28 AM, I've been up all night drinking and thinking about the day life ends. Hopefully soon.    

I'm only 25 yet It feels like I've reached the end of the line. Life is just a constant struggle of standing in line and trying to survive. No girlfriend, kids, friends, a broken family. It's just me, myself and I and Mrs. Brandy. I've contributed nothing to society and why should I? Society has given me nothing but pain and disdain for everything around me.    

Some stupid motherfucker gets in front of a camera and shows the world how stupid they are for 5 minutes. Now all of a sudden they have millions and have the fucking balls to say that they started a business!? Yeah society loves that shit. Hitting subscribe, follow, retweet, Keep feeding and endorsing it. I went to school, college, got a job and in the end I'm just another nobody with nothing to show for it. That shit gets to me.  

I feel uneasy posting this, not out of fear. I just don't usually share my problems, because hell nobody cares. Don't try and tell me things will get better, I'm past that. I've accepted the fact that most of us are destined to be trapped like rats in a maze for some sort of sick experiment. No matter what route you take there is no exit....except one.

So, I was rummaging through my folders to organise them since they're a mess. I found some things - On the left, is a note my mum mailed to me at the start of my first year of Uni as she knows how homesick I was, even though it had only been about 2 weeks since I left home. 

On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me. (Spider-Dan is another nickname of mine) in it, he thanks me for being the best brother he could have and drew a picture of himself and I fighting against a monster whilst I was super saiyan.

Seeing these two items instantly made me burst into tears. I just sat here crying, feeling completely broken. Guilty of the way I feel and how I want to die, knowing I have family that loves me. I don't want to be a disappointment to my mum, I want to make her proud of me. I don't want my sister and little brother to lose their big brother. I want to look out for them both and be there for them.

It can be so hard to carry on. Everyday I wake up not wanting to be alive, but I don't show it. I don't care about myself anymore. However, maybe things such as this are a reason to at least try.

Reasoning: The post mentions a lack of belief in the possibility of having real friends and a general inability to trust others. This suggests that the poster may have experienced past relationship issues or traumas that have led to a sense of distrust and difficulty forming close connections with others.

Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels disconnected from their friends and unable to openly express their true feelings. They mention that their friends think they have everything going great for them, but the persistent nagging thoughts they have don't align with that perception. This sense of feeling misunderstood and unable to share their true emotions can lead to a sense of alienation and contribute to mental disorders."

The issue I want to address is the stigma on suicide.

I know people that have been clinically depressed for decades, and I've watched them take no joy out of life. Why prolong it if you've been dealt a shitty hand? Is society being selfish in wanting to see that people can change for the better just to affirm its own views of the world? The mere mention of suicide brings throngs of people trying to ""help"", and often instilling false hope. Will we ever ever say, ""yeah, it's a shitty situation. Offing yourself is probably the best option.""

There is no cure for clinical depression, and I bet those who eventually do kill themselves were dragged through the mud before they did it, effectively prolonging their suffering.

One that really got to me was the one who posted about their engagement, moving into their own place together, graduating college, traveling, etc. I just broke down crying for 10 minutes straight after reading her post. 2017 for me was a blur. I cannot give you any highlights of my life because there weren't any for me. Just a lot of crying and regrets. I have no friends or social life, so it's really hard for me to do anything eventful.

It is ironic with me because I hate how much technology has advanced (social media wise) and how people are always on their devices nowadays, yet when you look at me .. I am doing what I hate other people doing. Sometimes I feel like if I grew up in the 80s, my life wouldn't be so bad.

For me, 2017 has been the shittest year for a while. It can go fuck itself. 

So, for one night only. I'm going to get drunk and direct all of the vitriol and negativity I usually spend on myself, at an entire year. From January to December. It can all get fucked. All of the darkest thoughts I have about me and others. For tonight, they're all for you, 2017.

I hope you'll all join me in posting the nastiest things you can think of about yourself or anyone. And direct it at 2017. Tonight, it deserves it more than you. Normal self-loathing service can be resumed tomorrow. It's gonna get dark.

* 2017, I hope you die in a house fire.
* 2017, if you ever have kids. I hope they get abducted.
* 2017, I hope you get not-quite terminal cancer in all of your toilet-parts and then get hooked on painkillers and end up selling your arse for heroin money as your family and friends look on and laugh.
* 2017, I hope all of your loved ones die in a car crash.
* 2017, you're not worthy of kindness.
* 2017, you deserve nothing.
* 2017, I hope you get pregnant and both you and your baby die in labour.
* 2017, I hope your dog stops loving you.
* 2017, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. In fact the only time I'd even consider giving you any fluids is if you were in a burns unit, burnt from head to toe. I'd have a wank on you. And that's only if I had AIDS.

Lastly, fuck you, 2017. In a few hours you'll be dead. And I'll still be here. Even though I don't really want to be. I still beat you. And that counts for at least ...something. Probably. Maybe.

"Consider this post: ""I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 
1. Hormonal imbalance. 
2. Anemia.
3. Depression. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting.  But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 

1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal.
He started getting abusive. 

Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world.  He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop.  He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. 
I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place. 


"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of abuse and a traumatic experience in a past relationship. The poster discusses physical abuse, including being slapped and pushed to the wall, as well as emotional abuse through name-calling and manipulation. This history of bias and abuse within a previous relationship is likely contributing to the mental disorders mentioned in the post."

She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.  If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient.  This is just not a possibility with her at this moment.  There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do.  I do not have much money as I am currently a college student.

Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship.

It also discusses the lack of health insurance and the difficulty in accessing appropriate care. The poster expresses their struggle in finding options to help their mother and their inability to provide full-time care.

We've tried as a family to get her to go to the doctor but failed. She's always been creative and outgoing but since we talked about my decision, she's barley left the house, gained weight, and is in constant anger. I don't know what to do and to add to all of this I'm not there with her. I live away from my family and that's made it even harder. Any advice would be appreciated.

Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's mother falling into depression after the poster made a choice regarding who they want to spend their life with, specifically mentioning that the girl is from a different culture. The post also mentions the mother's change in behavior, including not leaving the house, gaining weight, and experiencing constant anger. The post expresses concern for the mother's well-being and asks for advice on how to help her.

"Consider this post: ""Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends.

I don’t want any of those to happen.

Anyway, back to my best friend. Since she’s the one I’m serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. I’m starting to feel like I’m being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesn’t need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really don’t want to annoy her with how much I’ve been telling her.

Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and she’s been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel that’s the truth. Anyway, sorry about how long this was. I could go on and on about this, so I hope you understand. "" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's limited ability to open up to others about their depression and suicidal thoughts.

The poster expresses concern about burdening their best friend with their issues and worries that their depressive texts may have negatively impacted their friend's mental health.

Reasoning: The post mentions feeling like an outsider, not having any close friends, hating their family, and not being intimate with a girl in 6 years. These factors contribute to a sense of loneliness, isolation, and dissatisfaction in relationships.

I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness.

Since then I've been trying to find something to get me into that state again, but nothing even comes close. Sad songs. Rick and Morty. People talking about their life. Nothing.

They mention trying various things to recreate that feeling, but nothing comes close.

"Consider this post: ""I'm just so tired of feeling depressed all the time, and the stuff i used to have an interest in seems to be boring most of the time.

I've been feeling this for a good amount of years now because of a long story.

Have anyone else any experience with weed, because i've been smoking alot lately and helps me SO MUCH with my anxiety and the ""black and white"" look at the world(please don't tell me to stop, i know the risks)

Why is everything so fucking boring all the time, i feel like i am wasting my entire youth i'm 17, i don't see myself as an isolated nerd or anything i like to produce music on my computer.

I consider myself decent looking depending on the day, i'm not overweight nor skinny.

I'm so sick of being afraid of other people on and off all the time.

I'm a virgin because i'm so scared of girls. but when i am high i can actually speak to girls and make eye contact and just rest in myself, yesterday some girl sat right next to me on an almost empty bus, and when i wanted to go out she smiled to me, and another day i was having a fun time talking with a girl at my friends house(also high at the moment).

When i'm high i feel like i am my true self without a barrier trying to protect me from people.

Some days i am happy and i want to go out and meet people(not very often but sometimes) and other days i am literally scared of everything waiting outside my door

I am speaking with an psychologist at the moment, which is really good for me.

i am taking antidepressiv in a small dose, and i have daily suicide thoughts that i have spoking with my psychologist about.

I have nightmares almost every single night.

I don't know myself, i don't know who i fucking am!

I feel like i am missing out on all the fun

Am i missing out on my youth??

I feel completely lonely in this world even though i have some friends who care about me and i have my mom.

I'm sick and tired of being tired

I think that when people are depressed the see the world as it actually is without filter, if you know what i mean.

I have so much anger inside which sometimes lead to me getting extremely angry because of small things.

I would love to have a girlfriend, and since i'm so bad at speaking with girls, i don't know how the fuck i am going to do that

I would love reply :)

Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and bored with life, which can be indicative of a sense of alienation from activities and interests that used to bring joy. The poster also mentions using weed to alleviate anxiety and a ""black and white"" view of the world, which suggests using substances as a coping mechanism for feeling disconnected or alienated. They express fear and difficulty in interacting with others, specifically girls, but note that when they are high, they feel more comfortable and able to be their true self. These feelings of disconnection and difficulty in building relationships, along with the use of substances as a way to cope, point to a potential cause of mental disorders related to feeling alienated from others."
"Consider this post: ""tonight something strange happened. 

i was out with friends, we drank a little (i had about 3 drinks in 3-4 hrs) and when we left, we decided we’d go to the closest friends’ house and continue to drink. i was by no means wasted.

out of no where my chest began to tighten and my heart started racing. at the last second, i asked to be dropped off at my parents’. i told my mom what happened and she suggested that it was an asthma attack. I’ve had asthma attacks, and this didnt feel like one (no wheezing/ out of breath)

it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i can’t get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, it’s vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what i’m going to do in the future, a job, etc. 

the whole episode lasted half an hour or so.

i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this??

any help is appreciated :)

Reasoning: The post describes the physical symptoms of tightness in the chest, racing heart, and difficulty breathing. The poster also mentions feeling stressed about life in general and experiencing the same feeling in certain positions or environments. These symptoms and triggers are consistent with panic or anxiety attacks. The poster specifically asks if anyone else experiences this and if it could be a panic or anxiety attack.

"Consider this post: ""i see all the people celebrating, all the big lights, the fireworks, the ornaments, but none of it moves me even just a little. what is new years but just another excuse for all the sheep to get belligerent, numbing themselves from the bigger picture? ""tradition""? fuck that, there's no such thing behind it. christmas and new years are a masterclass in capitalism at work. valentines, easter, halloween, etc. are all crash courses in capitalism, but new years/christmas are the phd. it makes me sick. all these sheep spending all their hard earned loot on things they think they can't live without, which really won't yield anything of substance, only one fleeting moment of feigned happiness. is it worth it? are you so miserable that retail therapy is what you turn to to feel better for one moment? all this shit is a topical anaesthetic, never getting at the meat of it. society is so doomed. 

culture doesn't exist anymore. we're afraid of our history. on this relentless pursuit of creating a unified world we're negating our rich cultural heritages, which can be curated to leave out the negatives.

is sex really the *only* thing that matters in life? it seems it's everyones prime motive. make money. why? so you can attract cheap people who'll fuck you once they know you've got it? money is just another topical anaesthetic. might as well be monopoly money, because none of what it gets you has any real substance. the only reason you want it is so you can quench your insatiable thirst for fucking. anyone who claims sex isn't the core of it all just never got enough of it so lies to themselves, taking a fake moral high ground- fuck you. we're living in an era where plethoras of shit relationships abound. relationships formed not organically, but by way of swiping right on an app on our phones for fucks sake. absolutely repulsive, breading legions of hedonists who later in life will have to hide their pasts from their partners. ""wholesome""? what the fuck is that... a relic of a long defunct past. there's more to relationships than sex-appeal- it's those little idiosyncrasies which make you want someone in the long run; those little quirky things which make them uniquely them, which you'll never get to know just by swiping right. and even for those who don't dabble in this e-fornication, they're doing it all wrong for the most part. a great lasting relationship will only become harder and harder to find moving forward. and even those that exist, a lot of them are founded under false pretences. people are seldom honest, thinking their lies will get them ahead, but they only land you deeper in a hole. be honest with yourselves and with others. 

society today is pathetic. every single person, young or old, glued to their damn 'smart' devices which serve no purpose other than to dumb you down- perfect irony. i'm 28, but am living among hoards of technosheep instead of real humans who thrive off personal contact. it's sickening. everyone living their lives for your viewing pleasure, presenting you perfectly curated renditions of their ideal, which they'll never really have. everything is so shallow, never venturing to go beyond the surface. there might be factions of people who don't adhere to this new way of life, but fuck it, so what? it's only getting worse. 

buy, buy, buy, drink, drink, drink, fuck, fuck, fuck.

"Consider this post: ""Okay so this is extremely embarrassing and I have been called everything under the sun from lazy to useless, I have been out of full time employment since 2013 with only one seasonal summer job as a parts driver for a helicopter company last summer. 

In my previous work place which was known as a starter company for the trade I was trying to get into I worked myself into sickness and was bullied by grown ass men into depression. This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. 

So this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. 

So I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck  and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and  they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. 

Now I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist. I need work, I've tried applying for everything under the sun the past few months. Every day gets harder and harder at this point I think I should just kill myself to relieve my parents of a financial burden , and a embarrassment. I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. 

If you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me. It's hard for me to type this out and even harder for me to hit the post button. Sorry for getting pretty emotional towards the end and also for any grammatical errors English is my second language.

"Consider this post: ""I've recently been going to the doctor for problems with sleeping. I have bouts of insomnia, wake up feeling like I've barely slept regardless of if I've had a decent amount of sleep and feel tired through the day. I did all the tests my doctor could possibly think of and I'm perfectly healthy. When we first started my doctor asked if I felt depressed and I dismissed it because I feel the same as always. 

Now I'm starting to wonder if it's mental rather than physical. It's been like this for a long time, sometimes better, sometimes worse. 

I looked back through a few logs I kept of how I felt when I was so tired I could barely get up to go to work, and I would often write things about feeling disconnected. I haven't thought about it for awhile, but it's still there. It's not strong or oppressive or anything like that, just sort of a general sense of being in a dream, things flow past me and nothing really matters. People stop mattering, I stop caring about stuff I love, that kind of thing. 

So I'm starting to think that maybe I am depressed, but I have a habit of self diagnosing and scaring myself. I didn't really think about it before, since I don't feel 'sad'. But it all sounds like, at the very least, there's something mental going on that's making everything messy. Maybe it's just stress? I don't know.

I think I might look into it more, talk to my doctor about it, that sort of thing. Im at the point where I don't really care what it is that's wrong, I'm just sick of feeling this way and at the very least if I know what's going on then maybe i can do something about it. 

If anyone read this I could use an opinion (I won't take it as gospel but it'd help), some support or even just tell me where to go if this isn't the right place. I don't mind either way, I think it's good to just vent sometimes to think things through.

"Consider this post: ""and it is becoming difficult to stay focused. There is a loss of interest in activities I typically enjoy, a growing desire to be around/talk with friends, yet the drive to isolate is developing a storm within myself.

I am in my thirties, many worries I had in my twenties are gone (job, housing, making friends). The struggle is in the remaining challenges. I value myself by how desirable I imagine I am. I define my desirability by how needed I am in mainly non-monetary ways (i.e. work doesn't really count, though it gives me some strength). Often I find more time on my hands than others, which leads me to reach out to friends much more than being reached out to instead. My friends and family say they enjoy spending time together and we make small talk about promises to connect. Many friends and family are actually busy and may only find time to connect infrequently. I can only see/share a snapshot of our lives and our connections. This makes me feel like less of a person. I want more people (two to three friends someday day) I connect with more than quarterly or annually. 

This has been a generally positive year. This lull has been much less severe than in prior years (during the holidays specifically). The sadness is more powerful in the duration and lack of attributable events. I want a reason to be sad, to fight or deconstruct said reason and ""bounce back"" or at least have an argument against these feelings. 

The hum of daily activities continues, heavy in each moment. A white noise that slowly is clouding my routine ushering me closer to the basics of eat, work, sleep, then repeat. The fog is comforting in the simplicity of the path left for me to travel, however the path is not the direction I want. 

I want to see around me again, I want to clearly view my challenges and triumphs, and most of all I want to feel desirable again. The time it takes to push through this cycle is exhausting. I wish to rid myself of this monotonous hum that is pushing me towards isolation.

I have no real expectations of improving my situation from posting, yet I am hopeful I might be distracted for a bit by sharing. It provides a sense of value to think what I say has an impact on myself or others.

A while ago, I started hooking up with this guy. He's pretty cute, he's lively, outgoing, and funny. I started getting feelings for him, but I was afraid to tell him because I was afraid of getting hurt again. But life finds a way to hurt me anyways.

We hadn't talked in a while, and it made me feel like he was done with me. It sucked, but I knew it was going to happen eventually. Conveniently at this point, my ex hits me up. We start talking about how we're doing and politics (usually not good but we both enjoy talking about it), and then I noticed that he was getting....flirty?

Eventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now.

The whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. 

Life in general is terrible too. Relationship woes aside, I have one good friend, and nobody else. My brain is addled with mental disorders (autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder). My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it. I can hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, and even when I do, they just leave me more hurt than I was before.

It's all just terrible, and I don't think I can handle it much longer. I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken.

"Consider this post: ""Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. 

One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self.

Then some how we got guardianship of another. But legally I think I'm only reasonable for the 1. I dunno. 

But anyway we have been separated for a few years now. I still live with her for the same reason. Still married to her unfortunately. Wish I had the money for the divorce. So I sleep in the living room while she is with another guy. That doesn't bother me at all. She cheated on me though that I didn't even care when we decided to split up for good. 

I can't get a job right now cuz when I try to she does something to make sure I have to watch the kids instead. Like leave town for 4 days. Her boyfriend refuses to watch them. So I'm such at the house. 

I barely talk to my family cuz of some issues we had a few years ago. Read my posts and you will know. So they won't help me out. 

I never get time to myself and when I tell her I want to get out of the house she pretty much threatens to kick me out and take the phone back they I'm using. So i rarely get to go anywhere. 

I wish I was dead most the time. I take a bunch of pills sometimes to try and end it, but then I feel bad cuz of the kids. But I think they would be better off without me being depressed around them all the time.

I feel like my friends are using me in a sense that they only call me if they need help with college work or I'm the last option because the rest of their friends were busy. I can't do anything though because I don't want to risk losing the few friends I do have. They all come to me with the stories of the great nights out or the holidays they all have planned and when they ask what I was up to, which is rare, I just have to say ""nothing"" and it makes me so deflated. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months and that is due to the lonliness, I would get back out there and look for someone but I have no confidence in myself so I'm terrified to do so. I can't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because they shouldn't have to put up with it which makes writing it here a bit ironic but oh well. In summary I'm scared.

"Consider this post: ""I'm 21 years old and a complete and utter disappointment to those around me.

I dropped out of high school in grade 10, I couldn't do it anymore every day the pressures of school and a teacher who graded me differently than everyone else caused me to be physically ill. Every single day I'd use a friends phone and call my mom  sobbing to come pick me up. I was out of school more than I was at school at the point juggling my mental illness and fighting extreme stomach issues that ended up being gastroparesis. Dropping out feels like the worst decision of my life. My family treats me like I'm faking all my issues in order to get out of my responsibilities. When in reality I've been fighting as hard as I can. Juggling financing myself through my art, being homeless, and the crushing weight of my illnesses.

Everyone seems mad at me. My psych office has me on probation for missing too many appointments. If I keep missing them I'll be kicked out and left without my medication. I've been clean from self harm for probably 8 months but lately when I look at my scars all I can think about is doing it again. I don't have time to go inpatient and the suicidal thoughts keep getting worse.

I have people who love and support me but I still feel like I'm letting them all down. I don't know if my family will accept me because of my transition. I haven't told anyone but a few but I'm positive my older brother outed me to everyone and I'm too afraid to face them now. Im not ashamed of being trans but I am afraid of losing the last of my family.

I can't hold a job because of my PTSD. I can't keep friends because I don't think I'm good enough for them and my BPD just makes it harder to connect to people. I'm avoidant as fuck and all I want to do is shed all my mental illnesses and not have to feel this way anymore.

"Consider this post: ""I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. For a while now, I've felt like being kind of crazy is what makes me who I am and without these feelings and behaviors, I wouldn't be me anymore. During the summer I quit taking my medications and going to therapy because I thought it was a waste of time and that it was just a way for people to control who I am. Even on meds I still felt sad and wished that I could just die quietly all the time. I stopped taking them cold turkey and withdrawals hurt like hell, but I felt like the medications that had been poisoning my mind and changing me irreparably would finally be gone. I stopped going to therapy for the same reason. 
The meds hadn’t been working, but my attitude about my situation led me to spend the last six months in a really dark place and I wasn't able to study, eat much, or do basic things like get out of bed or take a shower. I kept feeding into my suicidal and self critical thoughts. At the same time, I kept thinking that I was just fake sick and the real sufferers have Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and that I was just all bent out of shape about a minor mental illness that millions of people cope with easily every day. This made me want to be sicker so that I could feel more special or like I had more inside me to be expressed. 
I guess I was wondering two things: first, I was wondering if anyone else felt like they needed their mental illness to have worth and fed into it like I did/do and second, if anyone felt like struggling with depression makes them weak because there are worse mental illnesses.

Furthermore, the poster mentions feeling like their mental illnesses are not as significant as others with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. This suggests a sense of comparison and a desire to have a more ""serious"" mental illness in order to feel special or valid.

I can be sad but it doesn't last long before I force myself to feel happy again. I can control it. I can control my happiness. I force myself to laugh and have fun and I feel the dopamine rush.

Hello,

I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me.

Reasoning: The post mentions a history of depression that was neglected for years, indicating a preexisting mental health issue. It also discusses living with an abusive father and experiencing physical abuse, along with mentioning the intention to major in psychiatry and having a high IQ.

Additionally, the mention of wanting to study psychiatry suggests a personal interest and potential career path related to mental health.

"Consider this post: ""Hey. Excuse my incoming rant, I just feel like I have to get a few things off my chest or they will crush me for good and I have never done this before. Also excuse my English - I am prone to not paying attention to the grammar when I get long-winded.

What a year this was. Well, not for me but for pretty much everyone else I know. Success just can't stop coming for them. Pretty much everyone is doing great, even the people about which I used to think that they would end up in my current situation. And then there is me, in all of my useless, depressed self, wallowing in my self-inflicted misery. The only things that were enjoyable to me happened on a macro scale so they didn't really affect my personal actual situation at all.

I'm 24, still living with my parents and lonelier than ever before. I spend most of my days at home, mostly reading and watching useless crap on the internet. I read books too, but not as many as I used to. I've got attention issues. 10 years ago I could tear through a 600 pages long book in a day, today I can barely go for 15 minutes before I feel like I have to do something else (like refreshing a webpage and seeing that nothing has happened) and then have a hard time coming back to whatever I was doing. I can still read fast but I feel like I've become addicted to the ever-avaiable constant stream of shallow information that is so typical for this day and age - I think I know more the American electoral system now than I have ever wanted to know even though I live half a world away. Still, I've read pretty much through the entire Western canon over the last few years, trying to find answers... to anything with nothing coming out of it.

I procrastinate... a lot. It causes issues at the uni where I have been behind on pretty much every deadline I've ever gotten and considering what I've been told about my latest paper I may not even be able to finish it. But the degree I am trying to get is useless anyway (I chose it a few years ago in a bout of depression after I quit my original pursuit of some economics degree), so it probably doesn't matter anyway. The worst thing is that I think that I actually have a good work ethic when I really set my mind to something, but I hardly ever actually get to that point and I have a hard time staying in it because my mind just goes somewhere else. I've tried to write a book - I think I am pretty good with words, at least in my native language, and I thought it would offer me some more opportunities for escapism (that's pretty much the only peace I get these days). I got really excited, spend 3 weeks on it... and yet once I stopped some 30k words in, I have been having a hard time getting back, even though I have the whole thing in my head.

Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems. A doc told me two or three years ago that I should see a specialist because my thyroid apparently isn't working exactly as it should. I've ignored that advice and now I fear going to see a doctor because they will shit on me for neglecting the issue. I think it's just an irrational fear of criticism and denial. I know that I should do it and yet I can't bring myself to it. I've been delaying and delaying, always putting it in the ""after that"" spot. I am an idiot. Telling myself that I am an idiot does not really help though.

I've got communication issues too. Had them for a long time. I was bullied a bit at school when I was like 12 but while I thought for a longest time that it didn't affect me (I've become friends with all those people overtime), it probably ended up affecting me more than I thought it would. It certainly put a dent into my school performance, even though that was probably paired with the fact that I did not have learn anything for my first 6-7 years at school because all that stuff was too easy for me and so I never really learned how to learn, if you know what I mean.

The worst thing is that I feel like there is no reason for me to not live a normal life. I am clever... heck, my intelligence is well above average according to everything I have ever been told. I look normal - I think I"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to medication. Reasoning: The post mentions several issues that suggest a need for medication. Firstly, the poster mentions attention issues and difficulty with concentration, which may benefit from medication to improve focus. They also mention procrastination and difficulty with completing tasks, which may be helped by medication to increase motivation and productivity. The post also references thyroid problems, which may require medication to regulate thyroid function.

"Consider this post: ""I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time.  About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better.  It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me.

Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling).

The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again.  I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"".

Of course, him being so emotional, he won't go to the doctor because he feels like it would be wasting the doctor's time. I was just curious if anybody here has had this happen or heard of this happening? Either with dose increases or changing strength of the actual tablet? "" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions someone the poster cares about who has been taking an increased dose of medication for depression. The poster describes the emotional and out-of-control behavior exhibited by this person, including excessive crying and slurred speech. The post also mentions the person's reluctance to seek medical help due to feeling like it would be a waste of time. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the relationship between the poster and the person they care about, as well as the potential side effects or changes in medication."
"Consider this post: ""Nothing but social anxiety and depression. Can't talk to my parents, let alone a doctor. Can't even talk to my counselor. No friends and I spend my time playing video games.

Literally feel like my life was taken away from me. Don't even know how to sleep at night without knowing she's with me. 


I don't have the grades for any university, and community college will be a waste of time. I don't think I even have the ability to succeed in a trade school, cause even there, you need social skills to become an apprentice in your trade. So I can't even become a plumber or a garbage man.

Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of social anxiety and depression and difficulty in talking to parents, a doctor, and a counselor. The poster also mentions not having friends and spending their time playing video games, suggesting a lack of social connection and alienation. They also express a sense of loss and despair over the recent death of their dog. The mention of feeling incapable of succeeding in school or trade school due to social skills further emphasizes their sense of alienation and disconnection from others.

The poster expresses disappointment in not having someone to spend New Year's Eve with and a general sense of sadness about their lack of friends.

"Consider this post: ""I don't think I've typed here much.. but it's probably going to be my second or third time.
Many years ago I was into a long distance relationship that started with a solid friendship in 2010. After years this guy from Mexico left and  I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either.
He replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. 

I think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid. I don't think I'll get anyone else in probably years since I only had two relationships (both long distance ones) and I had to wait like 3 years for the next one to happen. (the last one I had) 
I think I am doomed to die alone. 
I don't know what to do, I feel so much anxiety. I want to stop feeling things, I'm a failure at these things. I'm horrible with relationships and I wish there was a way for me not to feel anything anymore.

Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's experiences with long distance relationships and the impact it has had on their mental well-being. They mention feeling alone and crying themselves to sleep after their first long distance relationship ended, leading to trust issues. They then describe the challenges they faced in their second long distance relationship, including arguments, feeling demanding, and their partner eventually leaving them for someone else. This caused the poster to feel devastated and question their worth, leading to anxiety and a desire to stop feeling emotions altogether.

To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well.

"Consider this post: ""For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long.

For the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December.

At the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole.

I tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home.

The mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily.

These feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasn’t necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time.

Fall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I “blew up” often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldn’t feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parent’s situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside.

*Ups:*

**High energy**

* Shaky

* Hard to stay still

* Lack of need for sleep

* Pacing

Example: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasn’t. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer.

**Paranoia**

* Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends

* Believing others to be plotting against me in some form

* (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down

* Thoughts of people trying to kill me

* Government surveillance

* Loss of trust in those close to me

I really hate school, not because I'm not smart or anything, but I just have to go and see people who actually have friends/people who care about them.

I always have to sit with the foreign exchange students who can't even speak English (I'm american) because they are the only people who tolerate me.

I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life.

I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve?

I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve.

Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing breakdowns and crying while driving, as well as having a bad outburst at their boyfriend. These emotional fluctuations and outbursts could be symptoms of a mental disorder. The post also mentions feeling frustrated and extremely tired, which could indicate that their emotions and behavior are being affected by medication or medication-related side effects.

This is a particularly bad period, but even when it's better, it's still tough. I was randomly googling things like ""how to survive when you're depressed"" and one of the common pieces of advice is to be kind to yourself and accept that you're not operating at your normal capacity.

The problem is, if I'm operating only on 20% capacity, what do I do when my life is demanding at least 60%. I have so many things I haven't done. I missed a doctor's appointment yesterday, I ignored a friend's invitation today, my credit card is due to be paid in a week and even though I have the money to pay it, I just haven't yet. My fridge is completely empty aside from food that is two weeks bad. I haven't showered in 5 days. I have a massive laundry pile to do.

None of these things are unmanageable on their own, but there's just so much that I feel I can't do. How can I even begin to get help when I'm this bad? It feels like I've already reached my limit just refilling my water and going to bed.

How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself? The guides online say to recognise the small achievements. What do you do when staying in bed and not killing yourself is an achievement? It might be admirable from some perspectives, but the world doesn't stop for chronically ill people.""

She has a social anxiety, I've no way to get in touch with her, nor would I want to make her uncomfortable by being a random creep who follows her around, does research on emails /contact info etc, I'm not thinking about myself in this case because she purposefully hid her email address from youtube as well as contact info and I won't try to obtain it. I did try to look her up on facebook, and she hid everything from public, hence proving that it'll just make her even more uncomfortable if some random unknown freak sends her a random email to an address that shouldn't've been discoverable by public. This glass effect is SO bloody painful; I can see her, I hear her talk, yet she will never know about my existence, we will never meet, and never look at one another in real life, ever. It is new year's eve today, and I literally just feel like going back into my maths [I'm studying compsci] and not getting out of the world of mathematics for the next 3 months, I feel HORRIBLE, just so damn empty, tired, somewhat broken, especially when I realize that such people (for me I mean) probably will come up once every 20 years, judging by my past years. Obviously not suicidal, but my fucking god, I've never felt such a strong soul pain. I know it might sound cringy, and I'm sorry about that, I've just never felt this pain before. And if this is love at first sight, why in oblivion is it glorified so much? This pain is just so damn unbearable, especially knowing that I may, perhaps either end up being alone because such people are **ridiculously** rare, or marry someone just for financial stability, which most likely won't be the case for me; money means nothing if there are no feelings. 

Anyways, thank you for reading this long ramble, I'll try my best to recover and just, sort of move on, although I know that periodically I'll probably get dragged back to this person. *sigh*"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post expresses intense feelings of pain, emptiness, and longing related to a person the poster perceives as their ideal soulmate. They mention internal checklists for the perfect partner and feeling that this person meets all the criteria. They also discuss their inability to reach out to this person due to their concern about making them uncomfortable or being seen as a random creep. This unrequited love and the resulting feelings of emptiness and yearning are likely the cause of the mental disorders mentioned in the post."
"Consider this post: "" Came to cry and reminisce. And think of all the lives I could've touched if I wasn't depressed..."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?",This post shows causes of depression related to alienation. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster feels disconnected from others and believes that their depression is preventing them from making a positive impact on others. They express a sense of regret and longing for the ability to touch lives and suggests a lack of fulfillment and a feeling of being isolated from others. This sense of alienation and disconnection is likely causing the mental disorders mentioned in the post.
"Consider this post: ""Back in August I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication. I'm overall in a much better place than I was beforehand, but I feel myself slipping back. I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. 

Since I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline.

I doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway.

I think it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore. At the peak, I could go hours, sometimes a day or two, without a thought about killing myself. Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing.

I don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck. 

So, yeah. Is that possible? For medication you've been on for less than 6 months to just stop?""

Reasoning: When the poster says ""I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication,"" it suggests that they have been struggling with mental health issues.

"Consider this post: ""I’ve been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and I’m finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasn’t really helped.

I also asked him for sleeping pills and they didn’t help either. In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I don’t remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them.

Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant it’s like I wasn’t really asleep. Physically I’m well rested but mentally I’m not. Idk if that makes sense but I feel like I’m going crazy because in my dreams I sometimes “wake up” and think everything is normal but then previous events from the dream come back and it’s so confusing. Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and it’s messed up. 

I told my doc and he said most of the antidepressants have similar side effects and that’s kinda made me miserable. I don’t wanna trade my sanity just to stop being depressed. I’m honestly thinking about stopping meds again. Idk anymore. "" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?",This post shows causes of depression related to bias or abuse. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing lucid dreams as a side effect of medication and the distress and confusion it causes. The poster also mentions feeling mentally drained and that going to sleep is no longer a comfort. The doctor's suggestion to take medication in the morning instead of at night and the unsuccessful attempt to use sleeping pills indicate ongoing struggles with medication and its side effects. The post also mentions feeling miserable and considering stopping medication altogether due to the negative impact on their mental well-being. These experiences suggest that the cause of mental disorders in this post is likely related to the bias or abuse experienced through medication side effects and the negative effects it has on the poster's overall mental health.

"Consider this post: ""A bit of background: I've been struggling for 5 years with severe depression and I'm currently in my 3rd year of college. My main drive in life has been to eventually get a job over-seas (mainly anything involving national security or humanitarian aide) to help people around the world however I can. Currently studying Political Science with a minor on International Relations and have plans to continue through law-school. 

Thing is, I'm getting really restless along the way. I have a future job in mind that only requires a bachelor's degree but I'm afraid that a degree on Political Science won't really get me anywhere in the long run so I should have a law degree to back it up just in case things don't go as planned.

I've also considered going on student exchanges but due to economic problems in my family, we've had to prioritize our expenses on other necessities. I live in Puerto Rico so we've also had to deal with the aftermath of hurricane Maria; university's been delayed for months so any chances for internships clashed with the semester's new schedule. Due to all of this, I haven't been able to fulfill that desire to travel.

I feel like there's so much going on around the world and the fact that I'm stuck for a couple more years buried in lectures is killing my motivation. I've tried to distract myself through different hobbies, volunteer work and going out with friends but nothing's genuinely helping.

Don't wanna drop out of college at all but I'm finding the road ahead really tedious. I'd like to hear how any of you have dealt with a similar kind of rut and how I could maybe find that drive again to not let my grades go down cause of my depression.

I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. 
The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone.

"Consider this post: ""I invited my friend Ryan to brunch yesterday since it had been a while since I saw him and I wanted to catch up. He is 16 and a junior in high school; I'm 17 and a senior in high school. Things were going great until he suggested we go hang out at my house. I drove him over and we went into my room. There was only one chair at my desk seeing as I'm usually the only one in my room so he sat on my lap - he is bi and I am gay so we're both ok with that. Then I started to go for his crotch and he told me to knock it off. I stopped for a while but then I went back in again, eventually getting all the way under his pants. A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. 

I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that. It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off.

"Consider this post: ""3 years ago I moved in with a drunk. A man who drank at least a whole bottle of vodka a day. He would do the most random crazy shit he would punch a flat screen tv countless times for no reason, beat his girlfriend and bruise her, head butt her mom and scream and yell. One time he forced us to leave with his girlfriend at 12pm in the rain and we had to walk down the road until the cops came and  asked if we were okay. Things like this happened all the time. My bedroom was right under there's and I was forced to listen to them scream at each other and his girlfriend crying and screaming ,things getting thrown, her being thrown around and then having sex. I lived with them for 3 years and the final year I noticed a difference in myself. My room was kept constantly dark I would sleep all night get up and go to school and then come home and go right back to sleep when I was up all I could do is read for hours or watch tv blankly. I started to be rude to my mom and my family members. Whenever they would come in my room I would yell at them to get out (I'm pretty sure they just think I'm a cunt) before all this happend I got into a relationship with someone I didn't want to be with because I was being reckless. the last year I broke up with her (I don't even like woman either but I still dated her) I started to eat way to much and I started to stop talking. I missed a lot of school to the point where my mom was almost brought to court. I don't know if this matters but my style started to change and the music I listened to. I had no energy or motivation. At the time I didn't know I was depressed I just knew I was unhappy. 

Right now I have to share a room with my brother since we are staying with someone until we find our own place. The darkness comes out when I'm alone, and rn I'm constantly around someone which threw me into this state of numbness. It gave almost the complete opposite affect I can't eat I can't sleep I don't want to do anything and I'm still unhappy. I miss sleep. I want to come home and sleep so that the days will go  by until we get our house. I just want to sleep forever

"Consider this post: ""Some background information:

My lowest points were 2014 and 2015. I was 15 and my family moved to another country, but it wasn't what I expected which led me to stay isolated in my apartment for three years. I was too paranoid the people I met at school would see me active on social media and ask me why I haven't been in school. Which also meant I didn't contact my friends back home for a while.

When I visited home it was during the summer and we could only afford to stay two weeks. I tried to do as much as I could in those two weeks which made everything feel rushed.

In 2016, my last year before moving back home, I was in a long distance relationship, it was going great in the beginning but towards the end I could tell something was different and it led me to become obsessive with his activity on social media. We broke up before I moved back home but I found out my friend, who introduced me to my ex, and him liked each other. It did hurt since he was my first boyfriend and I felt worthless and I didn't deserve love because this was the outcome. I also knew they hung out but she was my best friend and I trusted both of them 100%. I have never felt betrayal like that. I wanted support from my friend group but they weren’t there for me so I lost them as well. 

I am friends with another girl who is separate from that friend group and she was all I had when I moved back. When I was living away I felt so homesick but now that I was back I didn’t feel welcomed. This all happened in May of 2017. 
Making friends has been difficult, I notice I’ve been having trust issues and I don’t let people get close easily. But I also crave a connection with people. I also feel left out when I see people I know doing stuff without me. Sometimes I get obsessive of other people’s activity on social media and all it does is make me feel worse and I want to stop. I never felt this way before moving so I feel like these are bad habits and patterns I developed while being away.

**Here are my main concerns/tl;dr: I notice myself spacing out a lot and focusing on the past rather than the present, sometimes I check where people are or what they’re doing via social media but it becomes obsessive, I don’t like that I get concerned about other people and care too much about what they think, and I feel like I focus on the negative too much.**

I feel lost but I know I want to be in a better place. The solutions might be simple but my emotions are clouding my judgment. I know this was long but I appreciate any help or advice. Thank you in advance.

In the past few years I've dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one. I've struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life and therefore never put any effort into anything I've done.

I've been on and off three depression medications in the past and now I just recently started my third. I truly can't tell a difference when I'm on or off the medication. I don't know if I have depression or just a lack of motivation to do anything. I don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even a depression medication that can help me.

My psychiatrist visits last about 5-10 minutes with her prescribing me a medication and sending me on my way. My parents really dislike her because of her medication strategy, but she's the only one in my area for 300 miles.

"Consider this post: ""Hey Folks,

I feel that I really need a place to vent. This past September I was accepted into a program I've always dreamed of being in which was a great win for me. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bitter sweet because my grandmother passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly after starting. It really tore me up because I had to move away in August and didn't ever call her before she passed. I guess always felt I had something higher up on the list before calling her and might have been scared to call her too so just avoided it. The next time I saw her in person she was on a ventilator and heavily sedated, a shadow of her former self. 

The next months I kept busy with school which kept me from dealing with this event properly. Things just got worse from there though as one of my aunts was found dead in her house (heart attack) and another underwent surgery and ended up in the ICU. I feel I buried myself in school, shutting myself out from my emotions and told myself I would work through everything when I got home for Christmas break. The first day home, however, my mom got a call saying that the aunt who had surgery took a drastic turn for the worse and was on her death bed. This takes me up to now. This aunt who meant the world to me died and I just have lost all energy to function and have shut down. I'm scared to go back to school with all of this stuff still unresolved and I just want to feel appropriately for all of these losses.

"Consider this post: ""Decided to go to my new primary care doctor in order to get a referral for my acute sleep apnea problem I’ve had since childhood. Decided because this was the first time seeing a doctor in several years, maybe I should get what is supposed to be an annual checkup(blood test, ekg, etc.). The first thing the doctor asked me was “are you feeling down lately? Are you depressed?”



I kind of shrugged and laughed “ehh I don’t think so”. She smile and told me it was all part of the checkup.


I told her I wasn’t feeling down, but I’m not too sure about my answer which is why I’m here. I’m going to try my best to provide all symptoms and events in order for you guys to get some idea of what I’m going through.



Let’s start off with the doctor visit. Out of the blue, I started walking outside again; in the dead of winter no less. I liked to blame my tendencies to stay locked up at home on my laziness, but now I find myself taking a stroll around my neighborhood every once in a while. I never really thought I was a full blown hikikomori as I’ve maintained a job for a short period where I had to interact with customers.,. I live in a very busy part of New York so there are many faces to look at and imagine where they’re all headed.


I recently applied for college as a returning student for the spring semester which is why I think it may just be anxiety or even college-mid life crisis because I am doubting my career path.



I need to prep for some of the classes as I have forgotten a lot f the materials.. it’s been a good year since I’ve gone to college. I know I should be studying, but I seem to be pushing the schedule back. I even planned out my schedule on my calendar app, but I end up just deleting the notifications and telling myself that I’d do it tomorrow. I hate this part about myself because I feel this is what led me to fall so behind in school. Everyone of my peers who’ve I’ve cut contact with have already graduated and live a decent life, meanwhile I’ve quit my job as a store clerk months ago and don’t know where the time went.




Activities? I stopped gaming but many people get into a period of malaise with this. I seem fill most of my day on reddit and watching shows when I’m not walking around outside.





 I move around the house aimlessly; idk what the deal with that is. I find myself walking into the kitchen and forgetting why I went there. I think I’m just watching what I eat. I’ve lost a couple of pounds which is great.



My sleep schedule is screwed but I am not forcing myself to say in bed longer than I have to. I actually hate laying down with nothing but my thoughts because my mind drifts into odd places that make me sad. I wonder what would’ve happened if my mother didn’t have issues with the first child. That would mean I would have never been born; my parents had me because the first one didn’t take.


Anyway I think about shit like that so I like to minimize my time laying in bed with nothing else but my thoughts so I end up watching shows on my tablet til I fall asleep. 


I’ve also never been good with sleeping near electronic devices since I was a kid. Just bad habits I think.


I haven’t attempted or even fantasized about leaving here so I guess that’s good. I have written an apology letter to my parents though and I’m scared to know what the intent of that was.

I was forcibly admitted to the hospital twice for attempted suicide (pills, and cutting respectively) and eventually got hooked up with a sliding scale office that had therapists in the West Seattle area that got me on a biweekly visit and eventually prescribed antidepressants. 

Over the past three years, I have moved multiple times, to different states, and recently moved back to Washington State. I had a counselor in West Seattle that got me the recommendation for antidepressants and they seemed to work for me; but after moving around (and losing most everything I owned in the process) I am thinking I need to get back to both therapy and medication; however, I don’t remember her name or phone number. West Seattle is a long distance from where I currently live in Federal Way, but I don’t know anywhere else to turn to.

It's an... oddly fascinating view I see when I look at myself outside this black bubble. I've dragged down those who are closest to me, because maybe they know, but I've never felt so grateful towards anyone for merely existing near me. 

I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between.

"Consider this post: ""Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

"Consider this post: ""My life feels like a sham. I am 23 years old working basically a dead end job that I have no desire to work in. My original plans were to use my undergraduate to get into professional school but I can't get into any of them so I am on the verge of giving up on those. I probably don't have any aspirations to be in the field I am in but with my parents pressuring me to go into this field, I felt as though I had no other option. I have no real hobbies other than playing mobile games, watching TV/Netflix/YouTube and eating.

I have a few friends but the relationships now feel surface level. I don't know if I could muster up the courage to tell them the extent of my depression. We have discussed bits and pieces of it, but never fully in depth. While the other friendships I have are mainly just hanging out playing video games, talking about music and getting high off weed, that's about it. I find no real joy in things anymore. The activities and things I do try, only remind me of how much of a fuck up I am because of my lack of life experience.

Growing up and currently I am an introvert. My family almost encouraged it becaus I feel as though they didn't know what else to do. I'm not sure how it all started if I'm being honest. It would be so bad that gatherings and social issues events where I didn't know people, I would pretend I was having nausea and hide in the washroom the whole time. Man, as I'm typing this, I'm just really ashamed at what I've become. Over the past few years I've tried to rectify these behaviors and I have seen improvements here and there (I don't hide in the bathroom anymore). However what I'm going to talk about next is probably one of the major reasons why I'm sad.

So in the 23 years of my life, I've never had a real relationship before. There have been moments I go to the club or try online dating where I flirt, but that's the extent of my romantic life. Introversion feeding into my depression has basically paralyzed my mind. Everytime I want to flirt, I switch into a different mode and act shy. At the same time, I try to avoid romance for reasons I've said previous. I'm very depressed with my life and what it's come down to. I don't like the job or the field that I've been planning to do all my life. I have no real hobbies or passions outside of sitting on my ass at home, nor have I developed any real skills. They say confidence is key when approaching women, but my self-esteem is shot to rock bottom and I can never find enough courage to bring myself to ask a girl on a date. On top of that, what happens when I do ask and she says yes, where do we go from there? 

I have family that is Christian but over the past few years I probably align myself as b in agnostic. Because of this, I don't really mesh well with my family and their friends since I'm thinking of completely different perspective. I still live my family and I love them so much, but I realize that this is not helping my situation. All I know is that it's going to take me a long time to save up and move out somewhere.

Speaking of moving out, I make terrible financial decisions. I spend money frivolously on entertainment and food. I also masturbate way too frequently which i know interferes with things such as my social and love life. I'm about 30 lbs over the ideal weight for my age and height but have no resolve or willpower to work out. I've had braces a few times and never ended up keeping the retainers so I still have crooked teeth. I feel like a fuck up every time I look into the mirror because of that. That is something I know I have to life with until I get the money to fix them myself.

That's the other thing about myself. If you haven't noticed by now, a lot of things I want to start or quit, I've never been able to. My will power and resolve is also rock bottom. I've tried working out, stopping masturbating, keeping straight teeth, you name it, I've never committed to anything.

"Consider this post: ""This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control.

There were other things but I can't remember...I’ve spent 3 years learning to forget. The day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. I was sitting down taking it all in when I just broke. My shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off. Around the end of the year I started getting these awful thoughts. Regret filled my life. There were so many things that I wished I could redo and I still do. Everyday of my life I think about it and think of how stupid I was. Iwas so careless and didn’t realize that what I had done could ruin my life. Now what I did exactly won’t be shared...if anyone ever found out I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. I can barely do that now and I’m the only one who knows. Summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. They aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...I started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday.

I was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. I ended up chickening out...but some days I wonder if it would have actually worked. Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didn’t. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didn’t even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldn’t find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually it’s what started EVERYTHING. And it’s all. my. fault. I hate myself for it.

"Consider this post: ""I feel like a hypocrite posting here, because I've only now started actually realizing I might have depression and I might've been fighting it for some time without realizing it, but today was a horrible fucking day and it got better just now. 


So. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I ""overcame"" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). 


I didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. 


So yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here.



What I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. 

But just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but  the moment I press ""submit"" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes. Because I don't have to feel good to tell depression ""fuck you!"" in the face. So fuck you depression!

"Consider this post: ""I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility.
But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship.
I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that.

I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person.
I know how good my life is right now so I don't want to do anything to damage it.
I don't have anyone that I am comfortable opening up to with my emotional stuff.
I don't know if anyone can help me try to get my head in the right place, but I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to take control of my own feelings.

I have never even been able to walk up to them and say ""hey I'm feeling down"" without it turning into a massive sprawl for outside help I don't want. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't want their help. It's not that I don't care about them, I just like talking to my friends a lot more. 

However, with parents such as these, they're constantly not allowing me to have the friends I want, do what I want, or make my own mistakes. 

They're keeping me trapped in an endless cycle of stress and sadness. My grades have failed because I simply can't keep up with my severe depression. But they don't get that. To them, I'm ""not trying hard enough."" And can I go to someone to vent, who I actually know and trust? No. They're a bad influence, weed smoker, etc. 

Not that I have a friend to run to, anyways. I mean, the only two people I even talk to are based solely on my comedic factor and emotional support(by that I support them) and so to them it seems like nothing is wrong with me. 

I want to be in a relationship, I do, but even at the age of 16 I've never had a girlfriend(serious, at least) and all my recent attempts have been met with rejection and then failed friendship. 

So I just don't know where to go. I can't keep up with grades, have no one to talk to, have given up on family, love, fashion, hobbies, school. Where am I to even go?

Not to top the traumatic shit that has happened to me. I have never told anyone, even complete strangers what has happened to me, because I don't trust anyone. 

Depression has made me way too critical of people's ulterior motives, so trust for me is an issue. Those two friends I trust wouldn't listen to me if I had a problem anyway. 

Not to mention my parents keep trying to send me to therapists and the like, even though I can't tell them what I've done, for fear of getting shamed/disowned/arrested etc., and even though I've told them this they don't care. They're trying to shove help down my throat, but with good intention. 

So, all in all, my life is in shambles right now. I just don't know where to run. Maybe someone will read this whole thing and listen and relate, but I doubt it.

"Consider this post: ""Hello,

I don't know if other people experience this silly cycle, but I keep finding myself in my room kind of craving some kind of enjoyable social interaction but when it's offered to me I turn it down as I know I'll just be an awkward mess when I get there. So I stay in my room beating myself up at a great opportunity to feel like a normal human by going out and celebrating with old friends.

Some days I can do the whole talking to people thing, it's like I don't even have to try. The words just come out and I'd like to think that I can be kind of interesting sometimes, but about 90% of the time recently I just have nothing to say to people. I want people to laugh at my jokes and I want to create deep and meaningful relationships, but as my brain just won't let me communicate with people outside of just exchanging infomation and I become a robot with nothing to say. 

I just came back from my family house where I can truely feel like myself without being judged and everything is in good fun. I'm open with my brothers and my parents and socially it's a great environment But now that I'm back in my student house I remember how I felt before. I can't be as open, I can't express myself and I've built a relationship with people in this house pretending to be somone I'm not just because I want to have friends so I don't feel like a total loser. I have some good times with these people, but quite often I don't enjoy the current topic or dislike the humor as they've run it into the ground with how often they make the same references or just by talking about stuff I can't relate to in the slightest. It makes me feel that I should be liking this things and I'll be an outsider if I don't.

It's not like I can just go out and make new friends now anyway due to the problem noted second paragraph. The rest of my life is going well, I have a nice job, family is great and I'm starting to lose weight. But without great experiences with friends I feel like I'm still majorly missing out on what other people take for granted.

I've just been offered an opportunity to go and hang out with some friends a few miles away for New Years, but with my anxiety and my socal weirdness just wants me to stay at home. I hate myself for doing it, and it's not the first time I've turned these people down because I just basically don't feel like it, but I know that If I try to go I'll just be awkward and make the experience a bit weird for everyone else there.

tl;dr: I want to be a reasonably interesting person to do it, but my brain just won't let me most of the time and as a result I'm a bit of a social hermit. I want deep friendships and good times, but If I have no personality most of the time, how is that ever going to happen?

I've felt like this for around 4 or 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where I'm not able to enjoy the joy of a good relationship with another human. I've not made seriously good friend since college (uk) and I feel that If I could get this sorted I could feel happy again.

Sorry if this post is a bit everywhere. I have Dyspraxia and what might make sense in my head might not make sense in yours. I hope I've explained myself well enough. 

Happy New Year.

Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship.

"Consider this post: ""This is going to be a long one.

Cliffs:
- I thought it was going to be something more 
- I wasn’t fullfilled 
- following your dreams doesn’t make you happy
- You are sold a lie to get you to consumed 

This is my story of quiting my job to travel the world and follow what I thought my passion was.

So for the past 6 months I have been planning to quit my job so I can start a travel vlog channel on YouTube and work on photography and film making. I bought some gear, I even got free products from companies because they believed in my vision. I honestly thought this was it, like I thought this was going to be my thing. I thought I was on the right path doing this. I thought this would be my dream. I thought travelling the world sharing my pics and videos would make me happy and fullfilled. So after 6 long months, the big day finally arrived. I was so excited guys like I was over the moon about it all. This wasn’t really a holiday for me this was my time to focus on my craft and work towards my goals in youtube, photography and film making. But honestly after a few days something started to change fast. I didn’t really feel good, I felt like annoyed that I had to edit this vlog or edit this photo. I became very unhappy and unfulfilled extremely fast. The only time I felt good was when I was high on mushrooms and drunk on alcohol (that was for nye only) but I started to ask myself “hey do you even enjoy what you are doing” and to be honest I didn’t. I thought travelling the world sharing my journey with everyone would be fullfilling, I had friends and others tell me they were inspired that I had the courage to do this, I kinda felt like they were looking up to me and that my decision to do this would make them more confident for them to go after there dreams and I know that is a very positive thing but that wasn’t motivating for me at all. 

I am a simple man. I don’t give a **** about money or fame, pretty much my core value is to live a happy and fulliled life and to be surround by good people. The 9-5 isn’t for me. Hats off to you if you are ok with it but for me personally I couldn’t think of anything worse then sit in a box under arterfical light for 8+ hours a day t days a week plus the commute. When the realisation that the thing I thought was going to be my thing wasn’t was the most crushing feeling I have ever felt. It got to the point where I almost broke down. 

I have had successful online businesses in the past, but even when they were successful I wasn’t happy because I quickly realised this is like a 9-5 where I am only doing it for the money, I felt no joy or fullfillment from it so I quit. I currently do crypto investing, doing alright with it. Made 2k today but honestly yet again I felt no joy front that. I think a lot of people see other people’s lives on tv or social media and say to themselves “I want that life” I was the same, but I quickly realised I was sold a lie. Some of you might comment saying “you are just depressed bro” honestly I don’t think I am, I believe 99% of depression cases are miss diagnosed. I believe a lot of it has to do with people living unfullfied lives. Yes maybe 1% have a chemical imbalance but I strongly believe majority of people are not happy because they are not living unfullfied lives 

Right now I am thinking of just going home take some time off to revaluate. I must say though this really is painful this feeling. Thinking that something is going to be your passion and honestly believing in the bottom of your heart this is your thing but then realising (especially so fast) that’ it’s not is depressing. I just wanted to make you aware that the whole “quit your job to travel the world thing” might sound cool and all but I promise you it’s not going to make you happy. To me the only way to live a happy and fullfilled life is to do things you actually enjoy, to be on a road and to actually have some sort of direction.""

"Consider this post: ""Backstory: I'm 21. My dad just turned 73. I have the typical father / daughter relationship every girl wishes to have. I was spoiled growing up. Yes, he's old. Yes, I was an accident. Yes, my parents are still together. Let's continue. 

Last year was big for me. Was promoted as the youngest employee company wide to have my position. I moved out. Travelled a LOT. Last year I also learned my dad's cancer had spread and it was a lot more serious this time. I was on my own, living my own life, for 6 months. I realized how bad things had gotten, and I broke my lease and moved back home to help assist my parents with things around the house. In May, he stopped treatment. He was given 6-9 months. We are now at the 9 month mark and he's on his way to a hospital bed in our living room. Meanwhile, my mom is a chainsmoker who is  coming down with pneumonia. 

Back to the point. My father is old, and has lived a very good life. I cannot be angry that his time has come. What I am angry about, however, is the fact I am now lost. Here comes my thought process.

Watching my mother take care of my dad in ways I would have never thought possible, how will she handle this when her husband is no longer on this earth?

He will without a doubt pass in my childhood home. When is the appropriate time to move out again? Will my mom be okay to take care of herself? 

I'm taking a lot of time off of work, and my boss is okay with it under the given circumstances. What if I'm not ready to return?

My mom lost her mother during the summer of 2015. Now she's losing her husband Spring of 2017, if he makes it that far. As far as family goes, it's just me and my brother, who has a family of his own. 

She's the type of mom who will spend hundreds of dollars on presents if it means not having to keep in touch daily / be a babysitter etc.. Not because she dislikes us, but because she has always been an independent, introverted.. er, bitch. When she does connect with you, it is something to be adored. She has a very unique way of showing love and it's the only love I have ever known from her. 

I keep having to remind myself that I am 21 and have my whole life ahead of me, but is that selfish? I'm not looking to abandon her after this is all said and done, but I ~feel~ like I need to return to my life as soon as possible. It's taking a toll on me mentally, and as a result, I'm isolating myself from friends and social gatherings. I just have no desire to do those things anymore. Some days its hard to get out of bed because I can't do anything. It's not that I don't WANT to get up start my day, I just lay there and think, ""whats the point? I don't need plans."" That's new. My parents are in the other room together 90% of the time, while I spend my entire day in my room trying to find things to distract me from my current life. I don't like thinking about the future because I feel exhausted trying to make those thoughts seem realistic. I'm either very irritable or so quiet that I don't think I can talk. The thought of going back to work to make money to resume the life I had seems unpalatable. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm stuck in a very large rut and I don't know what direction to go in, I just know that I need to get out of it.

TLDR: My dad is dying of natural causes, I put my life on pause to spend time with him, I realized that my mom might not do too well alone, and I don't know how / when / if I will go back to my life before I moved home or how I want to resume my life to move on.""

"Consider this post: ""I have progressed to a point where suicide is plaguing my thoughts every day. Any form of distraction: YouTube and Social Media, hanging out with my “friends” school.

I can identify that I am failing I am so pathetic all of my friends are just friends with me out of pity I can trust no one. Everyone has abandoned me and I feel like shit every single goddamn day. Thoughts of suicide and all of my past failures and embarrassing moments no matter how small, are all huge and I feel as if everyone    Either hates me, takes advantage of me for what little intelligence is left, or is just friends with me out of pity or to bully me and belittle me.

"Consider this post: ""Had a session with my therapist before the beginning of New Year's Eve. I was trying to explain to her my greatest fear. The fear of never being understood. I was diagnosed with depression in year of 2011. Since then I have sought out treatment in the form of talk therapy and medication. And in all this time, even before I was educated about my ""illness"", not once has anyone I've come into contact with been able to see the world with my eyes. Yet I can be so understanding and kind and caring and able to walk in the shoes of others. I want to make others smile, be happy, and laugh. It's why I'm reading, studying, and practicing to become an actor. But I can no longer hide behind this mask of false images and hopes that ""things will get better"". How is it I can live a solid twenty four years on this planet, down to the exact seconds from which I was born today, being part of a sociable species of animals dubbed humans and still not have a genuine connection with a single person? How? Bar forced seclusion and isolation practices, it should not be possible. I should not be possible. Yet I persist and endure and struggle to live as a thing. A creature. A human not worth the very effort it took to create and make this pathetic existence I call life something worth living. My therapist heard a similar story to what I have just written from me, (minus the whole being alive for a full twenty four years part), and it sounded like she was trying to contemplate an answer to justify my thinking as being a product of my depression. By this time tears were sliding down my face one drop at a time. Yet I felt as stern as an emotionless being. Then she said something that caught me off guard in a voice as sad and as hurt as a mother pleading for the safety of her child. She said, ""please don't hurt yourself"". The thing is, I can't understand if she was crying for me or for what I had just said being reflected off my face. And even if she was starting to cry......., why? Why cry for someone who has no place in society. Why cry for someone who cannot be fathomed by his peers or parents? Why cry at all for this hollow wound of a human she saw before her? Just why?""

"Consider this post: ""I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave.

My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling.

"Consider this post: ""I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state.

I was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to.

Gender and Sexuality
===============
I grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage.

In expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. 

Unfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice.

All in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world.


Socialization
==============
I am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. 

I am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah).

Despite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? 

I'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. 


Relationships
===============
I don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though.

Current partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues.

And the other hand full slag off depression as if it doesnt exist or they are worse off as if its a competition.

My family have their own issues and I feel as much as they would love to help they need to focus on themselves and each other.

They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me. There's nothing in the real world that totally takes over my mind, because no matter WHAT i am thinking about, always what is playing in the back of my head is ""this is pointless, this is pointless, this is pointless...""

But clearly there is something very chemically wrong with my brain and I just cannot take it anymore. I dream of going to the doctor and finding that I have a terminal illness, so that it will end and I will finally be free of the rock."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to medication. Reasoning: The post describes the presence of two tracks playing in the poster's mind, one expressing positive emotions and appreciation for life, and the other constantly discussing the meaninglessness of everything. The poster mentions feeling a sense of relief during brief respites when they feel normal, but these moments are short-lived. They also state that they do not believe they have depression, as they experience positive thoughts and do not feel socially isolated or inadequate. The poster expresses a desire to find a concrete root for their mental distress, but is unable to do so. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post may be related to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which may require medication to address."
"Consider this post: ""Where do I start? I guess the background: I am in nursing school, and this past semester broke me, I developed anxiety, and my depression returned. I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress.

Well last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. 

This thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. 

You see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. 

When I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help.  

So I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. 

So about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there. 

Thank you for reading, and I hope we all can overcome this."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to medication.

I live together with my 3 best friends because my home is too far away from school. Turns out one of them stole about 750-1000 eu from my room + A LOT of weed.

I sell weed to get by because i was blown away by how expensive living on your own is. Now all of my money is gone and i'm 1300eu in debt by my dealer.

My gf was the only one  trusted and i (still) love her dearly. But unfortunately she broke up with me just now because she can't be with someone who has such a negative self image of himself, and because i was never there for her (i did everything i could but sometimes you just can't do shit because of the depression and she doesnt believe that). She also said that i am selfish and that the whole relationship revolved around me, wich was the saying that hurt me the most.

I completely lost track of my own to get her to feel good, but nah she wouldn't have it. Commenting on my best friend who is jobless atm but worked HARD everyday on roofs and such for 2 years, saying he's a loafer with no ambition and i will become the same as him got me running to my car, bawling like a little kid (wich is something that nearly never happened in the past 5 years, i'm pretty 'cold-hearted'). 

We just returned from a super nice city trip where everything was as good as it could get, wich gave me hope because i tought that might be the spark our realtionship needed (we've been struggling in our realtionship for about a month) but i guess she didn't think so...

Everyday i have this urge to just drive against a pillar or off of a bridge but i can always come to my sensen when i think about my parents, who support me A LOT.

I don't even know why i bother writing this because no one gives a fuck about me (except for my parents probably) and this'll get buried anyways.

My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling depressed and suicidal, as well as a lack of belief in oneself. These feelings are likely exacerbated by the poster's perception of being alone and unable to talk to anyone about their struggles. They mention that their family is preoccupied with the sickness of their grandparents, leaving them feeling helpless and unable to contribute or seek support. This sense of isolation and burden is contributing to the poster's mental disorders and can be attributed to a sense of alienation."
"Consider this post: ""Ever since I started college (I'm a junior now) I feel so different than the person I was in High School. Back then people would tell me that I was funny, chill, nice, I was genuinely interested in people and made friends easily. But now I feel the opposite, like I'm just a dick, I never want to hangout with my friends and these are guys I have been best friends with since I was 5. We were literally inseparable, but now even keeping up with them in our groupme has become a chore, at this point my friends don't even want to talk to me anymore. Recently even the thought of having a social interaction is so scary that when it actually happens I feel like I seem distant and uninterested causing people to dislike me. I wish I knew how/why this all started, I just want to be me again, not this boring asshole who never has anything to say. I haven't told anybody this because I'm afraid they either won't believe me or think I just want attention, and I really just don't know what to do. Its like I just want to be left alone but I know that is not how I want to live my life. Sorry for the rant I just feel lost."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling different since starting college and experiencing a shift in their social interactions and relationships. They describe feeling like a different person and no longer exhibiting the positive qualities they had in high school. They express a desire to reconnect with their friends and regain their previous self, but also feeling scared and distant in social interactions. This suggests that the cause of their mental disorders may be related to changes in their relationships and social dynamics since starting college."
"Consider this post: ""So, I have really bad emetophobia. That means I have a fear of vomit. ?I have horrible dreams about vomit every night. Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish for? expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,? she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. 

This hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. 

I'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless.

Also posted in rbn"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to medication. Reasoning: The post mentions emetophobia, which is a specific phobia related to a fear of vomiting. The poster discusses having frequent nightmares about vomit and experiencing extreme anxiety and panic in situations where vomiting may occur. They also mention their family's reaction to their anxiety, with their mother getting upset and telling them not to ruin the family's day. This indicates that the poster's mental disorder, in this case, is likely caused by their fear of vomiting and the lack of understanding and support from their family. Medication may be a potential solution to manage their anxiety and phobia symptoms."

Reasoning: The post does not indicate any of the listed causes as contributing factors to the poster's behavior.

"Consider this post: ""Someone who will make me feel loved.

Someone who will not be annoyed when I text her in the morning, or one that will make me smile when I see her text saying good morning or good night

Someone who will makes feel like somebody and someone who will love me for who I am as I am for her.

_________________________________

I have been searching that particular person for years.

But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me.

Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life

Could be because she found a spark with someone else.

Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant.

Could be because she was not who I thought she was

Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again.

*And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens*

It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.
"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post discusses the poster's repeated experiences of finding someone they connect with and then suddenly losing that person. They also mention feeling cursed and as if fate is taking away their happiness whenever they find a sense of peace and tranquility. This suggests a pattern of relationship-related issues and difficulties in finding and maintaining connections with others, which may be contributing to the poster's mental disorders."
"Consider this post: ""I have no reason to feel this way. I am surrounded by loving family and caring friends but is there a reason for me just listening to slow music that appeals to me personally most nights and just feeling sad?

 I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. 

I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad.

I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it. Im not searching for a solution, just a means to understand this

P.s if anyone's actually interested the music i was listening to was the exis mixtape by roy woods and free 6lack by 6lack"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling sad despite being surrounded by loving family and caring friends. The poster also expresses a sense of self-doubt, loneliness, and a lack of luck with relationships. They mention that when they are socializing or using humor, they temporarily feel relief from these negative feelings, but they always return when they are alone. The post also mentions a recent failed relationship and the poster's difficulty in communicating with girls they are interested in. This suggests that the cause of the mental disorders in this post is related to the poster's struggles and dissatisfaction with their relationships or lack thereof."
"Consider this post: ""I feel like I’m not even a functioning human at this point. The amount of effort needed to simply get out of bed or do my homework unbearable. This is the first time where I have been able to see the physical effects of my depression just looking at myself in the mirror. And I’m at a point where my anxiety that comes with it is so bad that I would rather not do my homework and get yelled at than even think about it. I’ve never told anyone I’m depressed and I just kinda be the funny one at school or with my friends.

I’ve never gone to a doctor or psychologist or anything about my depression but I think I may be bipolar. I do (or did) go to a psychologist for ADHD and they said when I was like 10 I might be at risk for developing bipolar disorder. But that was that I’m 14 now and that’s my theory.

I don’t even know if I’m over reacting or something I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening to my rant."" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions feelings of depression, anxiety, and difficulty getting out of bed or completing tasks. The poster expresses a sense of being disconnected from others, as they mention never having told anyone about their depression and instead being the funny one at school or with friends. This suggests a sense of isolation and a lack of support, which can contribute to mental health disorders. Additionally, the poster mentions a theory that they may be bipolar based on a previous assessment for ADHD, indicating a lack of professional help or guidance in understanding their mental health. All of these factors point to the cause of the mental disorders in this post being alienation."
"Consider this post: ""What do you think about anti depressants? Do they work, are they bs, do they only trick you into feeling better at the beginning? Want to know people's take on meds. "" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?",This post shows causes of depression related to alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions anti-depressants and raises questions about their effectiveness and people's opinions on them. This suggests that the poster may be feeling alienated or disconnected from the medical community or society's perception of mental health and treatment options. They may feel unsure or skeptical about medication and are seeking others' opinions to potentially validate or challenge their own beliefs. This sense of alienation or disconnection regarding the use of medication for mental health is likely contributing to their mental disorders.
"Consider this post: ""I am 24 years old , unattractive, not smart(learning disability, autism), depression(since age 10, wanted to kill myself that young...yeah I know.

Yeah what do I do about it. I guess accepting my fate is what i'll do guys...
THe problem I don't know what to do about it, not so much of an issue of ""trying harder"", but understanding what I need to do ""not be depressed"" anymore. 

There really is no escape for me in this depression land. I might have to learn to like it I guess.... Well lets see how I feel tommorw morning reading this irrational post..

The therapists aren't helping and its kinda discouraging...

I don't need to ""work on my self esteem"". I am sick of that bullshit some counselors are trained to teach. Are they really that stupid?
"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to relationship. Reasoning: The post mentions several factors that contribute to the poster's mental disorders, including their self-perceived unattractiveness, learning disability and autism, history of depression since a young age, and difficulty managing mood swings. They also mention a lack of friends and dissatisfaction with therapy. While the post does not explicitly mention specific relationship issues, the overall tone suggests a sense of loneliness, frustration with their own self-perceived inadequacies, and a lack of support from others. These factors contribute to the mental disorders described in the post, pointing to relationship-related causes."
"Consider this post: ""This has been going on for years, but it wasn't till today that I noticed it was happening. I get this sence of relief when I reach out towards people to hang out, but they tell me they can't.

It happened to me today, I was home alone and craving human contact. I called my friend to see if he wanted to hang out, but he tells me that he couldn't cause he was working. I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out.

The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed.

Am I the only one that is a mess of contradictions?"" Question: What cause of depression does this post show?","This post shows causes of depression related to alienation. Reasoning: The post mentions a pattern where the poster reaches out to hang out with people, but they are consistently rejected or unable to meet up. This leads to a sense of relief at first, but then quickly fades and is replaced by depression and a longing for human contact. The post also mentions feeling dread and exhaustion when plans are made and carried out. These contradictory emotions and experiences suggest a sense of alienation and disconnection from others, as well as a struggle to navigate social interactions and find fulfillment in relationships."
"Consider this post: ""I just don't fucking see how the majority of people aren't fucking poor in the first place. I'm nearly fucking homeless, just barely making it by the skin of my teeth, with little to nothing going for me, with mounting debts, and somehow the majority of fucking people aren't dealing with this shit. I just don't fucking get it. How on Earth did my life turn out to be so fucking shitty, yet somehow most of everyone else is doing way better than me. I know a lot of people in my situation too. I see 'em all around and it's like we're fucking invisible. Nobody gives a shit about us and nobody fucking thinks that the fact that you can end up in this fucking situation in this goddamn country is bad enough to warrant massive change. No one thinks it's a fucking problem because it's only a million or two out of a couple hundred million. In fact, it fucking disgusts me that the majority can just write off ANY human life so easily. 

Bad fucking credit. No education. Fucking debts. No savings. Identity theft. And somehow this shit doesn't seem to be a fucking problem for most others. The fucking bleakness of the world is almost enough to drive me to go on a mass homicidal rampage. That's just how fucking ridiculous this shit is.
