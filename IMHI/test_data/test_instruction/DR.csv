"Consider this post: ""Ancestry.com - is it safe? Hello!: ) I'm a new user so if this post ends up in a weird place/thread, pls bear w me. Has anyone used Ancestry.com lately? They offer a two week trial but still require your credit card information. Is this suspicious? It doesn't cost anything for the first two weeks, and then you can end the trial so you don't have to pay anything even then, but I just feel a little uncomfortable dialing my credit card information on there online.... Am I being too doubtfull? Share your experiences? Thank you! If my English isn't perfect, that's because I'm not a native speaker."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. It primarily focuses on a specific concern regarding the safety of using Ancestry.com and asking for advice and experiences from other users. While there is a slight hint of uncertainty or doubt, it does not prominently display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post seems more pragmatic and seeking information rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Additionally, the mention of being a non-native English speaker suggests that any imperfections in the writing could be attributed to language fluency rather than emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Dini ticaret haline getirenler"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: it is not possible to determine if the poster suffers from depression. This is because the post is not in English and does not provide any emotional or personal information that can be analyzed for signs of depression."
"Consider this post: ""My mother and her tragically unlucky family Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance. My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go; So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two. But it gets unluckier. So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later) 1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that). But again, it gets unluckier. Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal. So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family. So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was. So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband. I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born. The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff. So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a tragic and unlucky history within their mother's side of the family, expressing feelings of shock, fascination, and a sense of being cursed. The mention of multiple deaths, accidents, and dysfunctional family dynamics contributes to a sense of hopelessness and despair. The poster also mentions their uncle's addiction, abusive behavior, and rejection of the family, further adding to the emotional distress expressed in the post. The overall tone is one of deep sadness, highlighting the overwhelming impact of the family's misfortunes on the poster's emotional well-being."
"Consider this post: ""A vent more than advice post my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me"" half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his."" and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row. not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me. tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post mainly expresses frustration and disappointment with a friend changing plans and not prioritizing the poster's time. While there may be some underlying emotions of hurt or feeling unimportant, the post does not exhibit the profound sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or numbness typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more focused on the specific incident and its impact on the poster's plans, rather than addressing deeper emotional issues commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids? I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not display emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster is seeking advice and experiences from others regarding the decision to have children. While there is a slight sense of uncertainty and questioning about the future, it does not convey a deep sense of hopelessness or emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more introspective and curious rather than despairing or overwhelmed."
"Consider this post: ""Anyone ever wish they were good at something? Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of failure and lack of accomplishment in various areas of life. The poster expresses a desire to be good at something, anything, that could bring happiness and fulfillment. The mention of having failed at everything they have tried and feeling good at absolutely nothing implies a significant level of self-doubt and low self-esteem.

"Consider this post: ""Who even cares anymore I’ve just learned to accept my thought and I realise things aren’t gonna get better.I have the same cycle every day just play video games mourn for death wish I had weed and listen to sad songs till the morning life has just become such a boring shit show. Even talking to random people has me fucked up cause i fuck things up tell me guys what’s the point of even living anymore"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests a deep sense of apathy, hopelessness, and a lack of motivation or enjoyment in life. The poster describes engaging in activities such as playing video games, mourning, and listening to sad songs as a way to cope, but even these activities seem to bring little joy or fulfillment. The mention of wanting weed as a means of escape suggests a desire to numb or escape from emotional pain. The question about the point of living anymore highlights a significant level of despair and questioning of the meaning or purpose of life. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""How I'm coping with the end of a friendship... I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.) So, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore. She's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy. I'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way. Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her. For example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday. (This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.) After a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her. In sum, I just decided to protect myself."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates some frustration and dissatisfaction with a friend, but it does not convey significant emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster primarily discusses their decision to end a friendship due to conflicts and communication issues. Although there may be some emotional impact from the situation, the overall tone of the post seems more assertive and self-protective, rather than indicating severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Helping a girlfriend with depression possibly? Hello, I want to first off say this is a throwaway. I also looked for similar post regarding what I will ask, but i really want a tailored answer for my own sanity. Sorry for being selfish, this is just hard. I have been dating this girl for almost a year and I know she has been slipping into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression. I will start with a time table. We began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle. We became extremely close with in two months and then out of the blue she tells me its over. I didn't feel it was a justifiable way to end the relationship. I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me "" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week ."" I talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves. This continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested. She returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation. I met with her once more to voice my opinion and she was just quiet and had nothing to say but sorry and that i deserve someone who loves me like Love her. Today she starts emailing me about how she just needs space and she wants me to still talk to her family. I really do not know what to think... My friends say fuck her move on. I have never had a connection or love for someone outside my family and I have had at least 3 relationships over 2 years (I am almost 30). This one really felt different, the way she looked in my eyes and the way we talked about all our joint desires, just felt so good. I just want everyone to know I am open to honest responses and please feel free to speak openly, I just hurt because I feel like this is when she needs me most, but also might just need her own time to figure her self out. Thank you for your time and help. Cheers, Your Reddit friend."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly indicates that the poster's girlfriend is experiencing depression. The poster describes their girlfriend slipping ""into an abyss of what I cannot diagnose, but seems like depression"" and mentions her feeling lost and depressed. The girlfriend's behavior, such as smoking weed excessively, sleeping excessively, and having a never satisfied state, aligns with common symptoms of depression. The mention of trying to distract her and encourage her with various activities and goals, but seeing no improvement, suggests the persistence and severity of her depression.

"Consider this post: ""Difference between antidepressent starting side-effects and hypomania? Hey all, So I've read about how SSRIs can send bipolar people who are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression / anxiety into hypomania or mania. I've also read that SSRIs can have activating effects during the start up period (including insomnia, restlessness, distractibility) that sound similar to some of the symptoms of hypomania. So if someone starting and SSRI experiences trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, spends money like it's nothing, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, starting up old hobbies, etc., how can they know whether it's a combination of start-up side effects of the SSRI + feeling (much) better from the SSRI (or maybe placebo / excitement from doing something about the depression) or an antidepressant-induced hypomanic episode? I know it's a question for a professional but I like to hear experiences also."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post discusses the potential side effects of SSRIs and how they can mimic symptoms of hypomania. The poster goes into detail about experiencing trouble sleeping, restlessness, increased energy, increased distractibility, periods of euphoria, increased spending, increased pressure to talk/sing/dance, increased responses to music and caffeine, and increased engagement in old hobbies. These symptoms align with the characteristics of a hypomanic episode, which is a key symptom of bipolar disorder. The poster acknowledges that they require professional advice but also seeks to hear about others' experiences, suggesting a personal concern or potential experience with this issue. The focus on the emotional and behavioral effects of medication aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression and bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that the poster may be dealing with depression or bipolar disorder."
"Consider this post: ""My best friend has completely cut me out of his life for a girl and i am feeling depressed Hey guys, ive known my best mate for 7 years and we finished high school and now both go to the same uni, we were so tight, like brothers. We were gym partners, helped other out with assignments, and hanged out so frequently. That was all until he got a girlfriend. He met with this chick like 5 months ago and i was pleased for the dude, he seemed happy. 5 months on he still seems so attached to his girl, he rarey texts me and we used to play xbox together but none of those happen anymore. On the rare occasion when we do go to hang out he is always on his phone texting his girl, infact even in the cinema we watched a movie he was literally texting her during the film... even on xbox i hear the phone go off every minute or so We done so much shit together.... i gave him a driving instructor with a family discount cos i knew the guy and he got his license now, i helped him raise $600 for a new pc, and even went into a lil business together where i invested and he knew the contacts. This dude was my brother basiclly and now he never has time for me, we were so damn close and i wish things could go back to how they were without this girl because she is so paranoid of him talking to another girl I dont get why he has done this to me, ive always been there for him and now he doesnt even respond to my messages, i see him active on facebook but doesnt even read messages... i helped this dude out so much in high school he was going to fail, i taught him some shit and thats how we got close and he passed literally because of me.

The poster describes feeling hurt and depressed after their best friend started prioritizing his girlfriend over their friendship. They express a longing for things to go back to how they were before the girlfriend, highlighting the significance of the friendship and the hurt they feel from being pushed aside. The mention of feeling depressed and mentally hurt, as well as not knowing what to do, indicate a level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""The one and only thing I want to and have a will to do is to listen to the music all day and space out in it. Everything else is boring, draining and dull. And I receive no mental pleasure from doing anything else."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of interest, enjoyment, and pleasure in activities other than listening to music. The poster describes everything else as boring, draining, and dull, indicating a lack of motivation or fulfillment in their daily life. This aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in activities) and lack of motivation. The emphasis on wanting to listen to music all day and ""space out"" suggests a desire to escape or disconnect from their current emotional state. Overall, the post conveys a sense of emotional distress and lack of fulfillment that is consistent with depression."
"Consider this post: ""My First Real Episode Hey guys... I just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that I have not shared with anyone close to me, I feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness. So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these words as I am now. Not to say that I'm ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes. With that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head. It's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself. I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical... I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of the emotional distress commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feeling a sense of nothingness, dread, and a severe low point. They express difficulty in finding words to describe their feelings and experiencing an out-of-body sensation. The mention of feeling like their body is giving up and the correlation between exercise and a decrease in feelings of loneliness and sickness suggests a lack of motivation and a potential loss of interest in activities. The poster also mentions finding solace in interaction with others, indicating a potential need for social support and a sense of belonging. The overall tone of the post is despairing, with the poster expressing a desire for improvement in their own life and the lives of those around them. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Does everyone else just hurt all the time It’s not like physical pain or soreness, it’s just this overwhelming feeling of exhaustion and numbness. Doing anything, from applying for jobs to walking my dog, is just so overwhelmingly exhausting and it feels like running a marathon. I’ve tried everything - exercise, diet, meditation, meds. Nothing is working. Exercise just makes me tired. I’ve never gotten that rush of endorphins. I don’t have any hobbies that make me happy or that I can even focus on long enough to distract me. Every day is a huge ordeal"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, exhaustion, and numbness. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed by even simple tasks and expresses a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment from activities that are typically pleasurable. The mention of trying various methods including exercise, diet, meditation, and medication without success indicates a prolonged struggle with their emotional state. The overall tone of hopelessness, lack of positive experiences, and the feeling that every day is a struggle suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real? There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why. Anyone else feel like this ? Sorry for terrible punctuation."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses frustration and anger towards people who joke or make light of depression, highlighting the stark contrast between their own personal experiences of daily struggle and the casual treatment of depressive thoughts and coping mechanisms as fun or funny. The mention of feeling like they are falling off the wagon and going completely bonkers suggests a significant level of emotional distress and a potential lack of coping mechanisms. The poster also acknowledges that even within the depressed community, experiences vary, indicating an awareness of the complexity of depression.

Reasoning: The post expresses a desire for a different solution to the problem of drugs being temporary. This suggests a dissatisfaction with current methods of relief and a longing for a more effective or long-lasting solution.

The post does not provide extensive detail about the individual's emotions or experiences, but the mention of drugs as a temporary solution implies a deeper underlying struggle that may be indicative of depression."
"Consider this post: ""dealing with an emotionally unavailable best friend I see my best friend a lot. I dont wear my heart on my sleeve but I'm emotional. I definitely give too much in a relationship and end up getting hurt because of it. My friend has troubles expressing her emotions and generally gets very annoyed when she has to ""prove herself"" because she feels like people should just trust her. She doesn't have many friends because of this. I always express my irrational feelings but when shes angry she doesnt want to say anything because she doesnt want to hurt me. I don't want her to hold anything in but I know that I would suffer because of the truth. How do I balance our give and take? Is there anyway I can help her open up? Or is that impossible?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster expresses some emotional struggles and vulnerability, such as giving too much in relationships and getting hurt, there is not a pervasive sense of hopelessness or despair.

"Consider this post: ""Not allowed to feel bad? I feel like I'm not allowed to feel bad. I'm an unimportant piece of shit and there are so many other people that need help and all the other people are a lot more important than me. I'm not considered as a person, I'm just something to use to pull yourself up. It's like I'm stuck in a swamp and all the people step on me and push me deeper down just to get out themselves. I guess I don't deserve to feel good. Noone will care if I will kill myself. They'll just use another person."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a profound sense of low self-worth, self-deprecation, and hopelessness. The poster describes feeling insignificant and unimportant, believing that others prioritize their needs above their own. They express feeling like they are being used and taken advantage of by others, comparing themselves to a stepping stone in a swamp. The statement about not deserving to feel good and the belief that nobody would care if they were to kill themselves further illustrate their deep emotional distress and potential suicidal thoughts.

"Consider this post: ""I starve myself When I get depressed, I just can not eat. Everything sounds so gross and eating just seems difficult. I’m a very small person, 5’4 and 100 pounds. It’s something I’m self conscious about but weight gain has always been a struggle for me. I’ll go through periods where I’m doing well and eat 3x a day and manage to put on a few pounds, but then something happens and I slip back into my old ways and the weight falls right back off. Does anyone else do this?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster starves themselves when they are depressed and struggles with weight gain. This behavior is often associated with disordered eating patterns and can be a sign of depression. The mention of feeling self-conscious about their weight and the cyclical pattern of occasional improvement followed by a relapse suggests a negative and self-destructive relationship with food. This, coupled with the initial statement of depression and difficulty eating, indicates a potential correlation between the poster's behavior and symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Should I meet estranged grandfather? I've never met my grandfather due to him and my grandmother being divorced, and my mother being the ""least favorite"" wants nothing to do with him. However her siblings are super close to him and my cousins have known him their whole lives. I'm not aware of any physical abuse that happened but I know verbal towards my mother and grandmother and their appearances and capabilities occurred as well as blaming my mother for the divorce. He has attempted to apologize to my mother for years and sends her cards which she throws away or returns. If physical occurred I would not want to meet him and I'm wondering if my mother is acting the way she is because she's hiding something. Also he has never reached out to me but my aunts say he asks about me regularly. He may have not reached out due to the fact my mother won't speak to him. But part of me doesn't want to care if he's not willing to reach out. I'm torn.... Any advice?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""No friend left behind? *short* I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least). Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship. Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her. I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way. I feel like if they didn’t want to be friends anymore they should say something to her to give her a fair chance. Am I overthinking this or on track?""

"Consider this post: ""I don’t want to be an adult anymore. I’ve been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parents to tell them how much I’m struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared. I know I’m a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons. 1) I haven’t had a decent job. I’ve been floating on jobs that get me less than five hours a week. 2) I don’t have friends. Granted, that’s because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skills at all. 3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I can’t even try to achieve them. So what I’m trying to do is work on myself. Today I started a new (third, I now have three of these stupid things) job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store didn’t burn down and no one told me that I was a failure. But literally as soon as the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I’m lying to myself. That I’m being naive by thinking that I did well, that I was probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I’m trying, so that has to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why don’t I feel like I should be proud of myself? I have no friends. In fact, during 2017, I was so excited to have made a great friend and I was completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and haven’t bothered reading the apologies they’ve sent me. I’ve tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I’m not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I’ll lose another friend. And logically, if I’m the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I’m the problem. Maybe I’m not meant to have friends. And I’ve always had big dreams for myself. But because of how I was raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I’ve been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I’m really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I’m trying really hard but I’m so afraid that I’ll be the failure I was taught to be. In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the days when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk things out so I could figure out what I was doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I can’t add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she’ll one-up me because I’m the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she’ll tell me that I should try (fill in the blank with whatever bs Facebook depression fix is trending). I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I’m excited. I want her to tell me that she’s proud of me. I really want to have a conversation with my dad that doesn’t involve the phrase “well get over it”. ‘Hey dad, I’m full of regret and turmoil’ ‘ugh just get over it’ well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that’s half an inch long and highlights everything about my face that gives me horrible anxiety. Maybe I’m really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my managers greeted me with ‘ew gross, what happened to your hair?’ And now I feel like I’m as ugly as I think I am. I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world wasn’t on fire or that I wasn’t drowning.

My husband was the one who initially got me to quit hurting myself and the thoughts keep haunting me more than ever.

So, I have a friend, who's had quite a tough life.(prefer not to go into details) I've always had severe anxiety issues, mostly social Such was the cause for major bullying. This, combined with family issues, put me into a deep depression, bringing me to contemplate suicide. All of this was before I knew this friend. I brought this up to him the other day, and he replied with ""all the shit ive been through in my life and im STILL GOING THROUGH and you you think about suicide because of your social awkwardness?""

"Consider this post: ""Classmate/ bullying problems I have a classmate who constantly bullies our other classmates. Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do. For example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about ""fake people"", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty. I dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It's getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome. Thank you"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""How To Befriend Someone I Had An Awkward Past With? I had this female friend that I met almost two years ago. Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that. After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do? Some might say that I should leave it behind, but I did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life I have never met someone so true, genuine and wholesome in my life so I cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me.

"Consider this post: ""When people ask you what you did for the weekend, or for your birthday, etc. I have no idea how to respond. My emotions have become so numb that I can't feel anything so therefore I cannot enjoy anything I used to like doing. I literally just go to work everyday for 8 hours, come home and browse the news and reddit and listen to music, trying to entertain myself but never really succeeding. There's nothing I can enjoy. So when someone asks me what I did I just say some crap like I just relaxed at home or something, I don't know what else to say. It's the worst part about depression for me. Not being able to enjoy anything. I don't even look forward to coming home from work because it's not like I have anything to enjoy at home. It's all the same dullness. I'd probably work 12-14 hours a day seven days a week if I could because it wouldn't bother me at all, I'm not missing out on anything. Too bad they don't because they don't want to pay overtime for me of course."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

"Consider this post: ""Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live. Since I was about 12 I've had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I don't have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it's actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I've always had a slight superiority complex. I don't hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I've always been the life of the party, but deep down I don't ever remember being happy. As someone who's highly ambitious, it feels as if there's a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread. Recently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I've been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I've considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I'm not a very emotional person. I've come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I've always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

The poster does not express low self-esteem but rather a slight superiority complex. They mention a lack of happiness and the feeling of living as a continuous chore.

A few times I've forced myself to draw I was garbage, but I figured that's to be expected since I haven't done it in a while. However lately I've found playing video games much more difficult because I find myself pressing the wrong button almost purposely, or not reacting to something my brain processed seconds ago. It's even gotten to the point where typing is difficult for me--every other letter I find myself making a stupid typo, and its irritating.

"Consider this post: ""I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth. We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me. I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses deep-seated anger, resentment, and guilt towards their grandmother, along with feelings of being trapped and exhausted.

This was fine until I was being neglected and cast out by my stepmother because I'm not her child and she didn't want me in the first place, she was just to desperate not to lose my father. so now that they have a baby things go her way a lot more. ( none of my family on my fathers side like my stepmother as she had a much better childhood and has become very stuck up from it ) I then stop spending as much time with them as I began to feel unwanted and my father has now become a very angry and belittling man who is uninterested in anything other than his laptop and phone. they began punishing me harshly for small things and neglecting my needs for example feeding me. because I had to earn my money to buy my own food if I didn't do everything they asked they wouldn't give me the money I needed to eat. so when I was 14 I started to lose weight as i had recently met a boy that I liked and we would go for walks and the obvious reason was that I couldn't afford to eat everyday but I did as my grandmother was secretly feeding me and giving me everything I needed and wanted as she noticed that I wasn't getting it. because my father and his wife are both very large people and visibly overweight they became angry that I was losing weight. they would regularly humiliate me in front of my relatives saying that I'm starving myself ( I wasn't I just really liked my now boyfriend and he enjoys walking) the older I got the worse it become until it got to my 16th birthday where it had gotten to the point they had gotten me my provisional driving licence and the cbt lesson so I can get a moped. this may seem nice but up until this point my birthday was just a garneted meal for me. they had also told my family to only give me money which they have taken and refused to give back no this day. their motive for doing this for me was so I had transport to the job they where forcing me to get so I had to start paying rent for my room.(my room is the place where things my father has that she doesn't like goes. this wasn't a problem to me as my father spends more money than he has on some really cool stuff) also useful information they claim money for me and have never told me this so they would also make me earn everything that I had and most of the things I had I paid for myself with the money I earned by doing everything they didn't want to do like pick my brother up from his school when he started going to the school playgroup. the only thing I didn't pay for was my phone. when I was 15 I became qualified to look after children so they decided to misuse this and make me look after my brother more than I would have liked coz it took time away from my social life and school work. they would promise to pay for my time but they never did and in fear I would be punished and made to do more work without pay I didn't say anything. on the day of my cbt my stepmother dropped me there and then left to go see her family for the rest of the day. this is fine but I unfortunately couldn't do the practical text which was driving on the road so they sent me home early.

"Consider this post: ""My friends fall out with the rest of the group as we don’t agree with them on genders. I’m just going to get straight to the point, I have these two friends ( I’ll call them Ava and Chloe) who fall out with me and the rest of my friends as they believe there’s more that two genders and the rest of us don’t believe that (I’m not saying they can’t believe that but I’m just saying the way that they act when we say we don’t is bad). They usually talk to us the day after and act like nothing happened, but it bothers me. So here’s a summary of what happens. Someone brings up the topic of genders, and then will say how they think there’s two, then either Ava or chole will get mad and will storm of or start shouting at us. Ava once called my boyfriend a “close minded cunt” simply because he said he didn’t agree with her. If they believe that there’s more than two genders, I am totally ok with that, it’s just that they try and make the rest of us believe it too and then put the blame onto us and it’s starting to bug me.

"Consider this post: ""Just ranting. It fucking annoys me when I tell someone I’m depressed and they say “why.” Like, when someone tells you they have the fucking flu do you ask why? How are people so dumb about mental illness? I have people who say “yeah, I was depressed before,” and I’m like “what did you do” and they say it just went away. Seriously? You just woke up and it was fucking gone? Poof? Everyone always has their golden fix for me too. My mom tells me to drink lemon water. My dad says “stop worrying so much.” My coworker says “meditate.” Exercise. Volunteer. Quit your job and go do what you love (which is what, exactly?). I try so, so, so hard to not be depressed. But if I’m not pushing myself 120% to stop it, it comes back, and I’m back to square one. And I can’t, I just can’t keep doing it. It’s just like pushing a rock up a mountain with no peak. My favorite are the people who say “you need to let go. Just let go of the past.” These are the people that post dumbass quotes on Facebook and Instagram who haven’t experienced a day of depression in their lives. Let go of WHAT? What does that even fucking mean? I ask these people to go into detail, and they don’t. They act like a fucking monk, and just say, “You just have to let go.” All of those people can go fuck themselves.""

It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she didn't really seem interested in being my friend. Now it's summer and I've tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together. I want to tell her how I feel and that I wish I could be her friend still but I'm worried it will just create a bad situation. I really don't know what to do."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress and sadness. The poster describes struggling with depression and anxiety throughout high school, and expresses a strong emotional attachment to a friend they had a crush on.

"Consider this post: ""So I finally realized something this week... Been stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void. I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.""

For me the last time in my life when I felt like I was truly happy was 2013 and 2014 (mostly the summers) Ever since then life has changed so much. My depression got worse than ever. I spend so much time reminiscing on the good times because life is so crappy now. Does it ever get better again or what? I keep telling myself this is just a stage and things will get good again but it just seems to get worse. Nostalgia can be a great feeling but it’s killing me now knowing how good life once was.""

"Consider this post: ""I just need my spirit to settle In its totality it doesn't have to be about wins and loses, or what I failed to do. Neither does it have to be about my past years and the thoughts that come with immense feelings that appears to haunt me. The behaviors and mentality that I have doesn't have to be the end all be all. One major thing to include that its not about growth or conquering something in life. I'm not living to grow or to become strong after a catastrophic situation. I am looking for my spirit to simply just settle. I'm not seeking any advice nor trying to raise my fist towards challenges. I'm not seeking any of that just a settling of the inner me. To me, that is important than anything else because I would gladly be able to live with that when I one day be out of this earth. I'm not the goal oriented type. Its not about climbing this ladder of life. I'm not here for any of what most people are striving for. I seek for my spirit to settle for all these years. That is what I'm chasing. Most people are chasing dreams, families, success, marriages, money, respect, and fame, but not this human. More power to them and I'm sure they will obtain all those things but I for one am not seeking to obtain. The human game is a serious thing filled with losses and wins. I don't wanna count anymore nor try to get to the next level of life. Cycling through the infinite regrets and regression. The only goal is for this spirit to settle some type of way.

"Consider this post: ""How does it feel to have an abnormal next of kin? I have a brother who people call ""retarded"". But actually he's not. Just family - the one voluntarily has patience with him understand that. When I was a kid, I only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things. We were watching TV and the editors were discussing some news, instead of listening and talking about related topics (as normal people do) he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information. If it's your family's case, maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something, but mine did nothing. When I argued with him over such false information, my parents even stopped me and said ""Why do you have to argue with your poor brother?"" I thought they would never tell him what's wrong and what's right. At age of 10, once he told me to pack things up 'cause we would go for a trip with my mom's friends, I had no doubt and did exactly what he had said. Of course, one day later I found out he lied. At that moment, he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed. That's the moment I realized he's such an attention seeker, he's selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself. Since then, my parents never listen to me as I say he's not a fool, he's slippery even. And others saying I was blessed because all the bad luck on his place so I could live, study and be the only child that parents could be proud of. He's been living an easy life 'cause people are working their asses off out there but he just needs to call mom and things will be done. And none would want to resent him making mistakes 'cause ""he's retarded, just leave him"" they say. I envy him. Should I be stupid in order to be noticed by my parents?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys strong emotions of frustration, resentment, and envy towards the poster's brother and parents. The poster describes feeling unheard and invalidated by their parents, who prioritize their brother's needs over their own. There is a sense of isolation and a desire to be noticed and acknowledged by their family. The mention of feeling envious of their brother and questioning whether they should be ""stupid"" in order to gain attention suggests feelings of low self-worth and a lack of support from their immediate family. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Martin Luther King Jr. And depression ""As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course""- King JR. Today got me thinking...We need to figure out how we can turn our discontent, anxiety, anhedonia, insecurity, self hatred, and the meaninglessness that we all feel into real world change that we can see, touch , and feel proud of in a tangible form. We need to figure out as a community, how we can re-direct our negative feelings into helping others, and maby in the process we will be helping ourselves. I think alot of us feel meaningless, and have a hard time creating motivation to get us out of bed, besides our rare and far between moments of clarity. If we could find a way to re-direct our negative energy and encourage eachother to work towards causes we believe in, we could change the world while at the same time changing ourselves.At this point in my life, I have a ""good job"" and financial security, but I still experience horrible depression and that underlying feeling that im a failure and living a ""meaninglessness existence"". I have come to find that the only time I really feel ""alive"", or any feeling remotely resembling happiness is when I am either on drugs, or when I am helping people and making a difference. The latter of those two has actually improved my life, and I am hoping that as a depression community, we can motivate eachother to help re-direct our sadness to further causes that are meaningful to us, and hopefully squash our cynicism. ""The Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another"""" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

The poster expresses feelings of discontent, anxiety, anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure), insecurity, and self-hatred - all symptoms commonly associated with depression. They also mention feeling a sense of meaninglessness and a lack of motivation. The mention of finding temporary relief through drug use further suggests a desire to escape from their emotional pain. However, the post also demonstrates some level of hope and resilience, as the poster expresses a desire to turn their negative energy into helping others and making a difference. It is important to note that while the post exhibits signs of depression, it does not necessarily indicate the severity of the condition."
"Consider this post: ""what's a friendship?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates a lack of understanding or familiarity with the concept of friendship. The question itself suggests a sense of confusion or disconnection from others. While this may not necessarily indicate depression on its own, it could potentially be a sign of social isolation or difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, which can be associated with depression. However, without further emotional indicators or context, it is difficult to definitively determine if the poster suffers from depression based on this post alone."

"Consider this post: ""The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally: * I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. * ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends. * I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. * ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person. It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me? I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself, and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness, meaninglessness or sadness. But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with. I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes their experience with depression, including a diagnosis of major depression and multiple suicide attempts. They discuss feelings of self-loathing, loneliness, and a sense of meaninglessness in their relationships and the world. The post also mentions isolating oneself from friends, leaving social media, and changing their image as attempts to escape painful memories and seek personal change. The overall tone throughout the post is one of despair, hopelessness, and deep emotional distress. The poster also expresses a belief that they cannot be fixed and that depression is a fundamental part of their mind. These symptoms and beliefs align with the indicators commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I’m working on a new app/startup to help you guys. Please read this, I would really appreciate any help/feedback. Hello everyone! I’m a current sophomore in college studying Computer Science and this summer I decided to work on a new app that caters to depressed/suicidal people who are going through bad times. I want this app to connect depressed users to people who are volunteers at crisis centers or just regular people in general that are willing to devote their time to helping the users. This app will be similar to twitch where the volunteer will go live (and you can see their face) and any user can instantly connect with them. First, the user will enter their information like: what their favorite tv shows/movies/music artists are, where they’re from, and what type of gender they’d feel most comfortable talking to. All this information gathered will be used to connect the user with a volunteer that closely fits those preferences (the user can swipe through all of the options that are given to them and they can actually add these volunteers to a list that they’d like to come back to). I want it to be a one on one session where the user can decide to turn his/her camera on, or if not, just use the microphone, or if they don’t want to do either of those options, they can just use the chat box provided. I want it to be a social platform where users can connect with other users and see what they’re doing. Basically a user is becoming friends with their “streamers”/“volunteers” and other users as well. Also, these one-on-one sessions can be changed to a room where there can be 4 users to one volunteer and that way more people can connect with each other with like a “chaperone”. I wouldn’t dare dream of making any money from this app and I know I need funding from VC’s to get this thing skyrocketing. That is why I am getting all the resources I need from my school’s entrepreneurial program and they are going to connect me to the people I need to know. I hate to say it but if I need to make shareholders money, then I’ll do it, but I don’t want to make a single dime off of an idea that caters to people who are struggling through something so drastic. This may sound far fetched but my biggest dream for this app/company, is to have a box filled with goodies being mailed to users when the holidays/Valentine’s Day/ birthdays come around that include: letters/voice messages from volunteers saying “Happy Birthday!” Or “Merry Christmas!” Or “Happy Valentine’s Day!” followed by more messages that has to do with the user. This box will also include a lot more goodies that has to specifically do with the user. I used to be like you guys. I can’t say that I suffered as much as you guys but I came to this sub a couple of times when I had no one else to go to. I had no shoulder to cry on in my freshman year of college which is why I think this app could actually mean something to someone. Please, we need to try and put an end to the huge suicide rate among children/adults in America. Please provide any feedback, whether good, bad, or helpful. Anything helps, really. I can also answer any questions you might have about this app. Please excuse my bad grammar, I’m a computer science major for a reason haha."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster starts by expressing their intention to create an app/startup to help depressed/suicidal individuals, which suggests a personal connection to the issue. The use of phrases like ""going through bad times"" and ""dealing with something so drastic"" indicates a deep understanding and empathy towards the struggles of others. The mention of having visited this sub for support in their own freshman year of college implies personal experience with emotional distress.

The poster further describes the features of the app, emphasizing the need for one-on-one connections, the ability to choose preferred volunteers, and the potential for group sessions. They express a desire for the app to be a social platform where users can connect with each other and see what others are doing, indicating a need for social support and connection. The mention of including a box of goodies for holidays and special occasions, personalized for each user, suggests a desire to bring joy and comfort to individuals who may be lacking these experiences.

Additionally, the poster shares their own history of not having anyone to turn to in their freshman year of college, which implies a sense of isolation and lack of support. They express a strong passion and motivation for creating the app, highlighting their personal connection to the struggles faced by others and their desire to make a meaningful impact in reducing the suicide rate among children and adults in America.

Overall, the post demonstrates a deep sense of empathy, personal connection to the issue, and a strong desire to help others who are experiencing emotional distress, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Life shouldn’t be this miserable Overwhelming anxiety is ruining me"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

The combination of these factors suggests that the poster may be suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""Close friend becoming distant.... So I’ve (f,21) had a friend (m,21) that I’ve known for over two years, and we typically text or snap daily. There are times where we are texting or snapping straight for a couple of hours or we get busy with other stuff so we reply when we have a chance. Two weeks ago we had been hanging out at his place and everything to me seemed normal. Then out of the blue this week I feel as though he’s become extremely distant. He stopped basically replying to me at all. It’s been a couple of days in a row that he only responds a couple of times in the morning and then is gone during the entire day. Since I’ve known him, he has never been this way. (I'm sure some might say he's in a relationship, but he's currently single. Plus when he was in a relationship, he didn't act this way.) So last week I had sent him something early in the day and he didn’t reply until the following day. I didn’t think much of it because the next couple of days we were chatting like nothing and I was sure he was completely busy. Keep in mind, this was a couple days before he basically went blank on me. It actually got me thinking of what I had said that first day and think why he’d be so mad possibly to respond. The day that it had all started I had told him I had applied to a place and had gotten a interview the following day. I told him this even though he’s told me he’s been applying to different places and hasn’t gotten a single interview. When I told him I didn’t think that it would affect him that much since he’s told me he’d never apply to the place I’m gonna start working at. (Like he straight up told me he’d rather die than work at that place.) However, he's not the type to be petty or take things like that extremely hard and to heart. I’m not sure how I should think about all of this.I have anxiety (which is why I’m stressing) but I’m telling myself he may be going through something and I don’t want to just push him. We’ve gotten extremely close enough to the point where we’ve discussed things that are vulnerable things. He's dealt with major stuff and so have I, so I also find it weird that he wouldn’t talk to me about any of it (if it was something personal). Should I continue waiting basically a day for a response, or let it ride out and see if he gets back to himself and talks? Do you think he’s trying to ghost me? Or should I ask him what’s happening? (And if I do what should I say so that I’m not exactly targeting him). He has depression and we have discussed serious matters so I don't want to make him feel bad. Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does express some level of emotional distress and concern about the friend's sudden distance. The poster mentions feeling stressed and anxious about the situation and acknowledges their own anxiety. There is also a mention of the friend having depression, which could potentially impact their behavior. However, the post does not exhibit the same depth of hopelessness or lack of enjoyment in life that is typically associated with very severe depression. The focus of the post is primarily on seeking advice and guidance on how to handle the situation, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain."
"Consider this post: ""I don't know what I'm doing wrong I feel like I'm doing everything I'm suppose to do to get out but I can't shake the feeling I'm just constantly on the verge of another relapse or I'm just on an uphill before another episode.

But recently since I came home from college for winter break I almost relapsed. I started to cry alot, my appetite died and the suicidal urges came full swing, I don't even know why nothing bad happened I'm doing great in school.

"Consider this post: ""Only 7 cigarettes today This sounds really stupid but I’ve never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. I tried for the first time today to cut back and used my iPhone stop watch to try and wait 3 hours before another smoke. Drank tons and tons of water. Currently I have only had 6 today but I’m putting in the cautionary one more just in case I do before I go to bed.

"Consider this post: ""I’m quite literally dead inside Even when I feel emotions, it’s just despair and sadness. The rest of it just pure numbness.

Right now I don't know if I should cut my ties as well, as I can't forgive someone who broke my mom's heart and also someone who can't be contented at all. I'm 24 and take full responsibility on her.

"Consider this post: ""I'm having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend Long story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I'll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off While I get the whole ""friends mess with each other"" idea, but it just doesn't fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I'm a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc. On the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can't help it I don't know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn't seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of: ""he doesn't mean anything by it, it's just how he is don't get offended"". But unfortunately, we don't mix that way. Now Jeff's not inherently a bad person, when he's serious he's actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate. But his behavior to me on a day to day basis just really really pisses me off"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""is there a comfort in sadness? my therapist, my psychiatrist, and my parents all say i’m “so much better” than i used to be. and i am. i know that. i don’t even think about suicide anymore and i haven’t self harmed in a few years. but my brain is still fucked up and it always will be. i can live with that. but not when all these people around me are telling me how happy i am. just because i’m better than i was a few years ago doesn’t mean i’m good. i’m better by comparison. but that’s it. and i hate being told how “great” i’m doing. but then i think maybe i’m just overreacting to the word “happy” because i’m more comfortable being sad. i’ve been sad for so long that there’s a certain comfort in it. sad is familiar. happy is unknown and risky. can anyone relate to this or am i alone?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a complex mixture of emotions, indicating a potential struggle with depression. The poster acknowledges that they have made progress in their mental health, but still feels that their brain is ""fucked up"" and that they will never be truly happy. They express a discomfort with being told they are ""great"" or happy because they believe it is only in comparison to their previous state.

"Consider this post: ""Today is my 45th birthday. Today is my 45th birthday. Being 45 doesn't bug me as much as the lack of accomplishments and life lived in those years. I've spent the last 20 years lost in depression. I'm tired, hopeless, ashamed, and emotionally defeated. I go to bed scared and wake up disappointed. People ask if I am suicidal, and my answer is, ""I'm open to the possibility."" People ask if I'm planning, and I say, ""No, not actively. I've already planned it out."" I can't understand why I am still here nor do I understand why I stay."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly exhibits emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of hopelessness, shame, and emotional defeat.

"Consider this post: ""I’ve been abandoned by anyone I’ve ever loved. My mother emptied the bank accounts and left while I was in school one day, 20 years ago.

Sister actually lives a few miles away, haven’t spoken to her in months. And recently my girlfriend of 4 years, who I was planning on proposing to, left without any warning, not even a talk. I haven’t spoken out loud to another human, barring work hours, in 3 weeks. I received my last non work related text 2 weeks ago. I keep trying to keep going, but I want to give up.

Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of abandonment and loneliness. The poster describes traumatic experiences of being abandoned by their mother, father, brother, and girlfriend, and expresses feelings of wanting to give up and feel nothing. The lack of contact with loved ones and the desire to end their life indicates a severe level of emotional distress and hopelessness commonly associated with depression.

"Consider this post: ""Is there any chance of me being able to fix the friendship? Hello all, Needing some advice on how to fix this friendship, or even if I should. So, I met this girl at a club, and before I knew it, we became great friends. She would come round my place all the time. We would drink. Have some deep conversations on really interesting subjects. And, most importantly, laugh with each other and just hang out. Being at uni and doing the same course, she would also always try to help me when I was struggling, which was something I really appreciated. Anyway, sometime before Christmas, I screwed up and hurt her feelings. She didn't tell me this, and I only know because I got it out of her - through text. I've tried to apologize to her before Christmas. No real luck. I wished her Happy Christmas and New Years. She did the same to me. Now we're both back at Uni. It got awkward, as I was with my friends and she was with her friends, both sitting at the same table. At this point, the WhatsApp conversation we had went like this:(she doesn't speak to me in person anymore or even look at me): ... [13:21, 1/22/2018] Me: Hi ....

While the poster does express a desire to fix a friendship and feels hurt by the current state of the relationship, there is no overwhelming sense of hopelessness or despair.

"Consider this post: ""There is a big chance that I will become a millionaire in a year or 2 I got involved in Bitcoin 2 years ago, bought a lot when it was 500 600 dollars. And based on my bitcoin increasing from trading altcoins and the increasing value in general I believe I can seriously become a millionaire in a year or 2. I am depressed though. I want to figure out how I can reinvest that money. Not for the purpose to make more but how I can make other aspects of my life better. I'd really like to hear what people think. And also I don't really know how to feel about this. I think it's important to be humble and I never want that to change about me. But I am going to become very wealthy. I have a certain perspective on money. Money isn't evil, it is a resource. It's power, you can use it for good or bad. I want to become a billionaire. You can save and dramatically change 1,000s of peoples of lives with that amount of money. I'd rather have that power than someone who doesn't have that perspective. Does this make sense? I just feel this way about money. I feel like people think it's evil and pursuing money is evil. But you can do good things with money. And I want to do that. How should I feel and think about this? What do you think? I am going to have money and power but I don't know how to use it to help myself."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

I talked to a friend a few days ago who is going through depression and she told me she wants to cut all of her friends and family off. I am taken aback — we’ve known each other since primary school!

"Consider this post: ""Life for me is gonna fall apart and it'll be the end of me (this is my first post and I'm on mobile so sorry if the formatting is off) So recently my parents have been on me (M 17) about getting a job, getting college information, SAT information, getting my licence and spending more time with the family. Tonight they both came at me and yelled about how I wasn't going to amount to anything and that I pretty much am ruining their current lives. They threw so much at me that it broke me and I broke down in the bathroom. My only remedy for all this pain is my girlfriend. She's there for me no matter what and understands what I go through. Recently I've been slipping a little in my grades (All B's and C's) and my parents have a very strict rule that if I don't keep good grades I'll have to leave my girlfriend. My problem is that if I leave her I'll have nothing to help me get through hard times. I'm only living for her and I'll have no point to be around otherwise.

I have two younger sisters, and we're all really close in age (my youngest sister is 3 years younger than me), but I'm turning 20 this year. So this new baby will be 20 years younger than me. I'm not sure how to feel. My sisters and I are fairly close, and I'm worried that we won't be able to bond with our new sibling because of the huge age difference. We'll probably have all moved out in a few years (I've been planning on moving out this year) so we won't even get to have time to make those connections like we did with each other. It's just that it doesn't even feel real to me yet. Like if I was told that a relative or family friend was pregnant, not my own mother. If anyone has any advice or experience with something like this I would be really grateful to hear it. Thank you.""

"Consider this post: ""Accidentally kissing my friend after a party, what did i fuck up So there's this situation that happened once a week or two ago that kind of made my pretty-close-but-not-best friend dude friend feel...distant? I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward ""accidentally"" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this. I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? Im well known for liking girls and have short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend.""

"Consider this post: ""Can’t fix anything in my life I’m such a fundamentally broken person. I’ve want to say I’ve been fighting for years, but that’a not true. All I can do is fucking run away from everything until the day is over. No action I take to improve myself can ever have weight because I’m so godddamn broken that when I try to do something to better myself, it just reminds me of how much of a fucking loser I am. I cannot handle the fucking *pain* that comes with self improvement. It’s not fun in the least. It’s humbling. Too humbling. And it just shoves in my face all the time I’ve wasted and all of the experiences I never had simply by virtue of being my self. Everyone who’s happy acts like life is just some natural occurrence. Like things just happened to them and fell into place. This couldn’t be further from the truth of my experience. Nothing ever just happens organically. Either I try hard and fail due to my lack of intelligence, or I don’t do anything at all. It’s hard to stay happy after constant failure and social rejection. I’ve never had interests or goals or relationships or friends. I never will. These thing don’t just happen. You have to be a certain kind of person for them to happen. I am not that person. I will never be that person because I don’t even know who I want to be, and if I figured that out I would be too insecure to become that. All I see in my future is homelessness and destitution because I came into adulthood with absolutely zero interests, special memories, or relevant/helpful past experiences. My memory of my life in general is so goddam hazy at this point, if I ever did have those things, they have long been gone to the abyss. I just think why. Why do I have to be so broken and dysfunctional among everyone else? I’m not even a real person. I’m a complete shell of what could have been a person. This is too difficult to come to terms with, while impossible to argue against. It is true. It is my reality. It honestly just makes me angry, bitter, and jealous of others, at a very deep, fundamental, human level, for what the healthy people have. I fantasize about taking two AR-15s and unloading on people. Maybe I know them, maybe I don’t, it wouldn’t matter. Often lives completely lose their value when my headspace gets dark enough. Not as the result of an “illness” but of the fact that I am who I am both physically and psychologically. Blind rage. That is what the result of my dysfunction is. Pure fucking anger at both the world and myself. Unable to cope with my grim reality, all I want to do is destroy. The only thing I could ever really destroy is myself. The thought of my life slipping away becomes more attractive by the day as I see how impossible my desires are and how completely fruitless any effort to change is sure to be, just like it always has. I can’t handle the responsibility of being alive and I don’t want to anymore. I’m just here for the hedonistic pleasures life sometimes offers, until either I or something else kills me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits a deep sense of emotional pain, self-loathing, hopelessness, and despair. The poster expresses a belief that they are fundamentally broken and unable to fix anything in their life. They describe running away from everything and the pain that comes with self-improvement.

The overall tone of the post is filled with despair and hopelessness, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Sometimes I regret not killing myself Life if so pointless..No matter what I do I’m always gonna be sad. My life is going no where."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of hopelessness, despair, and contemplation of suicide. The poster expresses regret for not having taken their own life, indicating a significant level of emotional distress and a belief that their life has no purpose or meaning.

"Consider this post: ""My bestfriend ruined my life. So, I am a 21 year old girl. I go to college, it's my third year and it all started two, almost three years. This girl, my ""best friend"" told me that her old friends from primary school came to see her and she invited me. I rejected it. I am very shy and anxious around people and she knew it. They were both boys, one of them being her old love interest and one of them... well. My future love interest, the man I thought my future. I've never been in a relationship, like I've said my depression and anxiety made me believe that I am not worth it and nobody is going to love me. So she asked that he wants to meet with me and how he can do that etc. I wanted to give my number to him, I told her that I would love to talk with him because she told me a lot about him. A basketball player -my favorite sports-, goes to San Francisco State University, loves motorcycles -like me- and wears all black -like me- and has blue eyes, dark hair etc. She told me that he doesn't use any social media, even his phone because he hated them as a kid too. I was like okay it's a oersonal preference. Like, at this point I wasn't serious. Because I didn't think he would like me. So I said let's try to talk with him because someone like him wouldn't like me anyway. On my 19th birthday I got an e-mail. It was from him. He was telling me happy birthday, how he wanted to write me and meet me. I was stupid, I flew with his message and we started talking. It was so beautiful. He was so sweet and kind. He was everything I wanted. Times go by, we decide to try ""us"" in a relationship. Mind you, until then I haven't seen him once, even though I asked to see his face. Not because I only care about physical stuff, because it was too good to be true. My mind, my mind wasn't accepting the fact that someone like him would like me. We started dating, talking each other 24/7 but without any Skype or calling. I haven't heard his voice once. One year passed, I totally fell in love, he told me he was in love and because of his family problems he couldn't open himself. Few things ruined me after our magical but almost ""it's nothing but a dream"" year. First he lied to me about visiting me 3 times. He told me that he gor the ticket and he was on the way to the airport. He never came. Second time I cried my heart out because of an accident. We were talking with my ""bestie"" the girl who met us, and she send me a conversation quotes. Her argument with one of her friends. When he sent an e-mail... The exact conversation she sent me was on the bottom of his mail. We used to send tons of hearts with each mail, I guess she forgot copying the hearts again. And sent me the conversation. Third time he decided to talk on Kik. You know after almost 1.5 years I wanted to speak normally, not with e-mails. I was so happy, I forgot everything he did to me, especially the mental abuse and fights about my male friends, I said yes open yourself to me, let me be with you etc. I was happy. A message came to me from an account with his initials. However without me having a chance to look at the message a notification about my bestie appeared on my phone, let's name her ""Aurora"" about opening a Kik account with his initials. I asked her what the fuck was going on and she told me it was a joke. He never send a message from Kik. Over time, my mental position got worse and worse. I'd hurt myself regularly, I'd cry at nights and I'd walk around without any emotions. Our friendship whit my ""bestie"" did end before me and he ended. When she got a new phone, her e-mail app gave an error. Until she fixed it he didn't mail me even once. Fourteen days. When her phone got fixed, he started writing me immediately. I knew it was her. I knew it was her from the beginning but I was too hopeful to believe that someone would love me. Now I'm here, with tons ıf new friends, friends I've made after her i, because her rude actions and poisonous words left us alone in the class.

The poster describes their ""best friend"" ruining their life by manipulating and deceiving them, leading to a deeply hurtful and damaging romantic relationship. The poster mentions struggling with depression, anxiety, and engaging in self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm. They express a lack of ability to cope with the situation, fear of attending school due to the presence of their former friend, and potential for harmful actions towards themselves or others. These emotions and experiences align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Trying to understand my depressed SO I'm sorry if I'm posting in the wrong sub. I just figured you guys could offer perspective So my SO is away for work (for more than a month), but we are still in the same time zone. Lately, he's been having bad episodes, but a week ago he said he had a really session with his therapist there. (I'm proud to say that he said I was the only person who managed to convince him to seek professional help!) So, okay, so far so good. When he has bad days, sometimes he likes to ""check out of the world"". He also feels that opening up about his struggles might be too much of a burden for me. But we had a discussion before wherein I said, I understand that you might need space, but let me know if you're having a bad day, and you're not in a chatty mood. Not sure if this was the right approach, but this was the time before the therapist and after we learned that he had to be away for more than a month. And for the most part, he's been open with me. This weekend really bothered me because it was radio silence, despite my check ins, and despite not asking ""how are you questions"". For example, we are both big football/soccer fans so I tried to talk about the World Cup. He is a huge fan of the French team which won the Cup. Nothing. My anxious nature is making things more challenging because now I'm thinking is it the depression or relationship issues? My anxious self might pester him for answers but I am not sure if that is helpful. So, I'm not sure how to go about this. Let him be and try not to freak out until he returns? Advice greatly appreciated. Thanks"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several emotions and behaviors that are indicative of depression. The poster mentions that their SO has been having ""bad episodes"" and talks about feeling the need to ""check out of the world"" during those times. This suggests a sense of emotional distress and a desire to withdraw from social contact, which are common symptoms of depression. The poster also expresses concern about their SO's lack of response and silence, despite attempts to engage in conversation. This can be seen as a reflection of the poster's anxious nature, but it also indicates a potential strain on the relationship due to their SO's depression. Overall, the post exhibits emotional distress, relationship concerns, and a sense of helplessness, which are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""My Best Friend Feels More Like My Daughter I love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her, you can know I'd be there in an instant. But I feel awful admitting that I really don't like spending time with her anymore. We're both in our late twenties and I'm sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents (a choice I completely agree was for the best). We've been best friends for the past decade and I've seen her through some really difficult times. She's faced a lot of struggles, mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life. Unfortunately, many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship. We spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out. I've gotten up at 3:00am to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she's scared. I've left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears. Days that are supposed to be fun (a movie, a game night, making dinner together) end up with me supporting her because she's upset about something, and suddenly the whole evening is gone. I don't want to exaggerate, but I'd say 70% of the times I see her I have to go into ""support mode."" And unfortunately, I've realized that I don't enjoy her as a friend and I honestly don't think I ever will again. The dynamic of our friendship has changed and it's never going to be what it was. Don't get me wrong, I care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me, but the fact of that matter is I've found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it's just not a pleasant experience. When we do hang out, it's not because I want to; it's because I feel that's what she needs. She's a burden. She's a burden I bear willingly. But she's a burden. I don't know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say ""I don't like you anymore, so please don't be hurt that I don't reach out, but god you don't know how much I care about you."""" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does express some negative emotions and a sense of burden in the friendship, but it does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The poster mentions feeling conflicted about their friendship and not enjoying spending time with their friend anymore, but still expresses a deep care and concern for their well-being. They also express a desire to be there for their friend if needed. This suggests that the negative emotions may stem more from the dynamics of the friendship rather than a pervasive sense of emotional distress associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""No one wished me on my birthday Yesterday was my birthday and none of my close friend wished me except for my family members. I wish all my best friends at exactly 12:00 clock , video-calling or texting whatever suits them. I normally avoid attention and don't care about such things but this really bugs me. They are the friends that I meet everyday and had expectations , just a acknowledgement would make me happy. I know this sounds like attention-seeking behaviour and I generally don't care about such things. I am happy in under my own skin but this makes me a bit sad"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals a sense of sadness and disappointment caused by the lack of birthday wishes from close friends. The poster mentions that they usually don't care about such things, but this particular incident has affected them and made them feel sad. This suggests a desire for connection and a need for acknowledgement from their friends. Although the post also acknowledges the possibility of it being perceived as attention-seeking behavior, the overall tone and emotional response indicate a level of sadness and vulnerability that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Birthday Vent I haven’t celebrated my birthday for years now.

It hurt, but i guess people eventually get used to being ignored. Happy 20"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys feelings of sadness, hurt, and being ignored. The poster expresses that they have not celebrated their birthday for years and have received minimal recognition from their family. The fact that their entire family went out to celebrate the birthday of a family friend and left the poster behind adds to their feelings of being excluded and ignored. The mention of getting used to being ignored suggests a resignation and acceptance of this treatment, indicating a potential pattern of low self-esteem and emotional distress. These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""What do I call my sister that’s not my sister? This would seem fairly complicated, I have a step brother and my step brother lives in a family his family has his real mum, step dad and step sister his sister isn’t related to my dad or my mom but related to my brother because they both have the same mom and me and my brother only have the same dad but different mom. So basically she doesn’t have my blood but has a brothers blood (my step brother doesn’t live with me) so what am I suppose to call her?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not indicate strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It appears to be a question seeking advice or clarification on what to call a non-biological sister. While the content may be confusing or complicated, there is no significant expression of emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair. The tone of the post seems neutral and focused on gathering information rather than conveying overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Slight ups and massive downs. I get these feelings where I'm able to do things while still having depression then I have these moments where all hits me. Not wanting to get out of bed feeling so negative. It's just something I wish I could just wake up from and realize it was all a dream."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post highlights the presence of fluctuations in mood, with periods of slight ups and massive downs. The poster describes feeling able to do things despite having depression, but also experiencing moments of not wanting to get out of bed and feeling overwhelmingly negative. The mention of wishing to wake up from it all and realizing it was just a dream indicates a desire to escape from the intense emotional distress associated with depression. Overall, the post demonstrates a significant impact on the individual's daily functioning and a yearning for relief, which aligns with symptoms commonly seen in depression."
"Consider this post: ""“I wonder how the world would be if they didn’t have me” I heard this lyric and it sticks with me....fuck"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of despair and self-doubt. The lyric mentioned by the poster suggests a preoccupation with thoughts of worthlessness and contemplating how the world would be without them. The expletive ""fuck"" following the statement indicates a negative emotional reaction. These expressions of hopelessness, self-doubt, and negative emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""new venusualean friends at rabun county"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The response ""No"" suggests that the poster does not suffer from depression. However, based on the given post, it is not possible to determine the emotional state of the poster or whether they suffer from depression. The post simply mentions making new friends in a specific location, which does not provide enough information to make an accurate judgment about their mental health."

Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their ""you're my best friend"" and ""I love you, I care about you"" shit. The thing is I guess I'm pretty pissed off because I've always struggled to make friends but even when I have they don't give a shit. I'm so tired. Honestly, fuck everyone."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays strong emotions of frustration, anger, and disappointment, but it does not exhibit the core symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression. The individual expresses feeling overreactive and vents about a specific incident with a friend, highlighting their struggle to make and maintain friendships. While the post conveys some level of exhaustion and disillusionment with people, it does not demonstrate a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair that is typically indicative of very severe depression. The tone of the post suggests more annoyance and frustration rather than overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""My best friend of 11 years got engaged and I wasn’t invited. So, I just don’t know how to feel it’s not her fault that I wasn’t invited or told about it. Her fiancé didn’t bother to call us (my other best friend and I). He had his family, her family, his best friends, and their amway business partners(that’s a whole other hot mess). But anyway, I was working and got a phone call from an old friend and asked me how excited i was that my best friend was getting engaged. I replied “I had no idea.” She just said, “Oh..” I’m so hurt. But I don’t really think her man cares. He doesn’t like me and our other friend for reasons unknown to me. Now I’m asking myself will I even be invited to the wedding?

Why wouldn’t you even let us know that you were going to do this?? A text would’ve sufficed.. *sigh* really trying not to dwell on this but it really makes me hurt inside."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a significant amount of emotional pain and hurt. The poster expresses feeling excluded and left out by their best friend not inviting them to the engagement and not informing them about it. They also mention feeling hurt by the fact that the fiancé doesn't seem to care about their presence or feelings. The post shows a deep attachment to the friend, as they have known her for a long time, and a sense of confusion and sadness about the situation. While this post does indicate emotional distress and feelings of hurt, it does not exhibit the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, such as overwhelming exhaustion, numbness, or a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment in any activities."
"Consider this post: ""Is youth wasted a result of mental illness or is the mental illness a result of wasted youth? As hard as this hits me and as much as it demotivates me, I personally think it's the latter... At least it looks like it in my case"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of despair and self-blame. The poster suggests that their youth has been wasted and implies a lack of fulfillment or enjoyment during this period of their life. They also express personal belief that their mental illness is a result of this wasted youth. This indicates a negative self-perception and a strong association between their mental health and their perception of their life experiences. This aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, including self-blame, hopelessness, and a negative view of oneself."
"Consider this post: ""A Question About Honesty in Communication My friend recently graduated from Business school with a degree after 3 or 4 years. However, she continually asks me very simple, basic business questions that many non-business majors would know, stuff that I would think would've been covered over the first few classes. She's originally from a different country and still struggles a bit with English yet she went to school in Canada where all the courses were taught in English. The way I see it, if there was that much of a language barrier, she wouldn't have been able to pass. Even if she had gotten help with her studies, she still would have needed to retain this knowledge long enough to pass her exams, which weren't that long ago. The only thing I can fathom is that she had other people doing her work for her and taking her exams but I don't want to believe that and, besides, it's a bit of a stretch. As well, she currently has a mentor who's supposedly helping her conduct business research, yet she still messages me with questions about assignments they've given her, saying she doesn't understand basic stuff. I even told her that if she doesn't understand what her mentor is assigning her, she should be forthright and tell them, otherwise they wouldn't be able to fully help her. She agreed but I noticed she's still asking me the same questions insteading of contacting her mentor. Anyone have any insight into this? I've brought up similar things with her that I felt didn't make sense or were inconsistent but she's rarely honest, preferring to answer dismissively or cryptically. Not sure how to proceed from here."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on the friend's behavior and inconsistencies, and the poster's frustration with their friend's lack of honesty and dismissive responses. While there is a brief mention of the poster feeling unsure of how to proceed, it does not exhibit the profound emotional distress, hopelessness, or pervasive negative emotions commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post leans towards seeking advice and insight into the friend's behavior, rather than expressing personal emotional struggles."
"Consider this post: ""Losing years at a time to depression, 27 still haven't finished 4 year degree. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to cope! At this point I have no idea how to even get back to the pathetic life I used to have.

I just don't know what to do any more. I just turned 27 I have been in university since I was 18, trying to finish a four year degree, I was on my way to be done university May 2016 and then as per usual I needed extensions for all of my last four courses.... that was almost two full years ago......... I still have three more papers... WTF is wrong with me... I haven't worked in 5 years, I live in a property owned by my parents and live off 1000 dollars a month that's from settlement from an accident (it will end very soon). I go weeks at a time without leaving the house.

I dont know why I do this and I hate myself for it. Went to therapy for four years made me feel like garbage. Tried five different therapists one on one and three different groups. Has anyone been through anything like this? Has any one gotten out of their own self created self destructive hell?? I feel stupid, Ive struggled with depression my whole life and it was one thing when I was a kid growing up in an abusive and dysfunctional family but Ive been an adult for almost a decade now and ill I've done is fuck myself over by being a stupid coward."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness. The poster describes losing years to depression and feeling unable to cope or know how to move forward. They express a strong sense of shame and compare themselves negatively to others, feeling like the most pathetic person. The mention of struggling with depression their whole life, going to therapy for years without success, and engaging in self-destructive behaviors indicates a prolonged and severe struggle with their mental health. The overall tone of self-hatred, despair, and desperation aligns with symptoms commonly associated with severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""All I do is work and sleep and stare at the wall Unsure about it"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of apathy and disinterest in life. The poster describes a lack of engagement in activities beyond work and sleep, and mentions staring at the wall, which suggests a sense of ennui or emptiness. The phrase ""unsure about it"" adds a note of uncertainty or indecision, which could be indicative of low motivation or a lack of purpose. These symptoms align with depressive symptoms such as anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure) and lack of motivation, which suggest a potential diagnosis of depression."
"Consider this post: ""Feeling good about helping people Does anyone else here ever feel better about themselves when you're able to offer a little help or guidance to someone off the street you don't know? As an example, sometime last month I was having a pretty meh day, just... Not feeling the worst ever, but not feeling very good either, when on my way home I happened to find an iPhone sitting on a grate outside the subway station. I picked it up and looked around for the owner, then after entering the station found a couple of young women searching their bags and I asked if the phone was theirs. It was, and they said ""thank you so much!"" And I felt really happy that I'd been able to help them, like, I just kinda decided right then to forget about my problems, because, I'd helped someone. Like, maybe those two would have never found their phone if I hadn't come along. I mean they probably would have, but, y'know. I felt like I'd been helpful in a real small but meaningful way and that felt good. I really like helping people, but I usually get upset when I try to help people I actually know personally, because, well, people don't always want help with more personal issues, or even with simple issues from people they know well, and trying to tell when to help or not is just really complicated. Like, I'll just real nicely try to suggest a solution to a problem, or simply offering some consolation, and instead of, I dunno, actually trying it or telling me patiently why that isn't a good idea, they just rail on me and tell me to shut up or whatever. And I just feel like, jeez, what'd I do? I'm trying to help here... And I always get real upset about that and doubt myself over it, like, am I doing a bad thing by trying to be nice? I know that's not true, I get sometimes people want to figure things out on their own, or I guess you don't like my attitude or blablabla, but, I dunno, you can't maybe acknowledge that I'm trying to do good? But in a situation where it's just strangers, trying to find their way, cross the street, lost a thing or whatever, it's easy to tell when they need help, because everything's a lot more straightforward, if that makes sense. If someone needs help, it's usually pretty obvious and they're almost always pretty receptive to help, and, provided you just look like a normal person, they don't judge. No biases or baggage over past interactions or whatever, they're just happy to have help. So yeah I guess this is a little longer than it needs to be, but, yeah. Helping random people feels good and distracts from my depression a little. Is what I was saying. Anyone else feel this way?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a mixture of positive emotions related to helping others and a sense of personal fulfillment and happiness derived from those experiences. The poster describes feeling uplifted and distracted from their depression when they are able to offer help or guidance to strangers. Although there is a mention of feeling upset and doubting themselves when trying to help people they know personally, this does not overshadow the overall positive emotions and sense of purpose derived from helping others. There is no indication of intense emotional pain or despair commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is generally upbeat and hopeful, with a focus on the positive impact of helping others."
"Consider this post: ""Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life... I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs. About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me. I immediately broke down crying upon reading it. It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something. It changed my life, and probably saved it. So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough. And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let's all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post clearly describes the poster's experience of being in a ""really dark place"" and their depressive state, which has included strong suicidal thoughts. The poster expresses feeling like an ""idiotic nobody"" and lacking a sense of worth. However, the tone of the post changes dramatically when discussing the Reddit Secret Santa gift they received. The poster describes breaking down in tears upon receiving the gift and feeling like someone cared about them. They mention feeling motivated, happy, and having a newfound sense of purpose. This significant shift in mood, from profound despair to hope and appreciation, suggests that the poster may be experiencing symptoms of depression. The mention of the gift potentially saving their life further emphasizes the profound impact it had on their emotional well-being."
"Consider this post: ""Went to a therapy centre for the first time today I hesitated so much before going, I almost went back too many times. I actually got the address wrong the first time and knocked the door on a young lady asking her if she’s the therapist at the address that I have. Anyway, I’ve filled out the forms and I’m waiting to be contacted by the centre, it’s scary and weird."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of hesitation and anxiety about attending therapy. The poster describes almost backing out multiple times, which suggests a significant level of emotional distress. The mention of getting the address wrong and mistakenly approaching someone else indicates a high level of anxiety and difficulty with decision-making or concentration.

"Consider this post: ""No hope There is no hope left for me. The sun doesn't shine. There is no light in my life. There hasn't been for awhile. All I do is go through the motions and I give up even doing that. Why don't I have the courage to end it?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong sense of hopelessness and despair, stating that there is no hope left and no light in their life.

"Consider this post: ""I've really hit a new low I cannot believe how depressed I am right now, I am just imploding. I got fired from yet another job for being incompetent as usual. Usually I'm pretty good at bouncing back but this job just broke something inside me. I'm a damn failure. Three attempts at college. Flunked out after the first year. That's ok, college isn't for everyone. Try a bunch of min wage jobs. Get fired or quit with in the first month or two. I can't do damn thing. I have no motivation to do anything at all anymore. I used to clock around 3-4 hours a day gaming because it was something I genuinely enjoyed. I've gotten 30 minutes in an entire damn week. I literally just can't muster the strength to want to do it. I've been pulling away from people because it's just exhausting to talk to them. I literally just get tired after five minutes of conversation. It's insane. We'll barely be through the how's your day been going before I already want to go somewhere else because it's so draining. I've hit a complete rock wall in therapy. I tell my therapist nearly all of this shit and she helps me as best she can but there's only so much she's able to do. She has no magic way of instilling me with motivation. Like... to put it into perspective. I stared at a wall for 2 hours today. Because I just was to tired to anything else. 2 hours! I wasn't thinking about anything. I wasn't being bored. I just don't have motivation to do anything! But what's worse is the moment I start thinking again is the moment all the sadness washes over me. It's like I'm in the middle of a vast, dark ocean and can't find shore. I swim and I swim and I swim but salvation is just nowhere to be seen. And I'm beginning to grow tired. I have no future ahead of me. Nothing to look forward too. I go through thousands of career tests and applications and all I see is that I'm either not interested enough or not good enough for any career. And I can't simply work for money. Money in and of itself just isn't good enough for me to work at a job I hate or am completely uninterested in. That's the strain of these minimum wage jobs, some of them I've had to quit because they've literally made me suicidal. I'm so lost right now. The world looks like a very dark place where I have to suffer in agony just to get by. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of trying. I'm just. So. Tired. It has been a very long time since I've been this low. I feel like I'm doomed. Like this is all the happiness I'll ever be afforded. That even if I get the job of my dreams and all the money I could possibly want, I will always have a big, dark cloud hanging over my head. Everything hurts and I hate everything about life right now. I wish I could just fall asleep and stay in my dreams."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and despair. The poster mentions feeling depressed, imploding, and considering themselves a failure. They express a lack of motivation and enjoyment in activities they used to enjoy, such as gaming. There is a clear withdrawal from social interactions and a feeling of exhaustion after minimal conversation. The mention of being in therapy and feeling stuck despite their therapist's efforts suggests a prolonged struggle with depression. The vivid metaphor of being in a vast, dark ocean without finding shore conveys a sense of being trapped and hopeless. The mention of thoughts of suicide and the belief that they will always suffer and be unhappy indicate significant emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Today is gonna be tough I have been doing okay for a bit now and haven't really been in a slump for a couple weeks but today I can't help it. Been thinking all of last night about it and now I am pretty torn up. By no means am I a traditionally religious person. I believe in a god, Jesus died for our sins, and all that good stuff. But I don't walk around preaching and forcing what I believe onto others, instead I try and be humble. I am really struggling here with my depression here as I write this out on my lunch break at work. I don't know if I can make it through today. I just got to thinking last night and a few days before: at this point, is it faith or apathy? I just don't really care about anything anymore, not for a long time, many years, in fact. I have always run my life according to my faith. God will provide, God will meet me half way, be thankful for all that I have. I am not struggling with my faith or anything but why am I still around? What am I looking for? What am I waiting on? I am by no means struggling with my faith but rather where does the line cut off between having faith that things will turn out versus just not giving a shit about anything hoping things will turn out? I don't know, I guess I just want to lay down for awhile. Dream it all away. Pretend that life isn't bearing down on me or that I am happy. I just want it to be over. All of it. Just take me home, wherever that be."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of emotional pain and despair. The poster describes feeling torn up and struggling with their depression. They question their faith and express a lack of caring about anything for a long time.

"Consider this post: ""I hate myself I have nothing but contempt for myself. My feelings just don't want to feel anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post clearly expresses a strong sense of self-hatred and contempt. The poster states that their feelings do not want to feel anymore, suggesting a deep emotional pain and numbness.

"Consider this post: ""Wife complains that I sleeps too much. I wanna say because being asleep is better than living in the reality that is my life, but I don't know how to explain it to her without hurting her feelings. She knows I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster's life is unpleasant and they find solace in sleeping. They openly express a desire to avoid the reality of their life. The mention of being diagnosed with depression and anxiety suggests that they are already struggling with mental health issues.

"Consider this post: ""I dont have friends. So i was talking over phone to my female best friend. I was sharing my problem with her i had recently. Now we supposed to hung up. But unfortunately phone didn't cut. And i was able to listen her. She was telling my thing to her roommate in cooked manner. And I came to know that she was jealous of me all those years because I was good than her in studies and anything. And she was thanking god for failing me in my recent exam. This thing just broke my soul. She was the last person i could trust. Now I am depressed af. I didnt say a thing to her till now, i hung up phone myself, when i couldnt listen more. I dont know how to react when i am going to meet her next time."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses deep emotional pain and betrayal. The poster shares the experience of overhearing their best friend speaking negatively about them and admitting jealousy. This revelation has deeply affected the poster, causing them to feel depressed and questioning their ability to trust others. The post conveys a sense of despair and uncertainty about how to navigate the situation and react when they next meet their friend. These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly the feelings of sadness, low self-esteem, and a sense of hopelessness."
"Consider this post: ""help with friends/roommate situation I have been trying to be friends with my roommate for months, but recently noticed she uses me. I always invite her to hang out, I do all the cleaning, I bake her food, do sweet things, helped her when shes throwing up, taken care of her, and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others. She's never once said thank you or has reciprocated, and my mother and a friend called it into my attention. I was fine with it (sort of), but I really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends. But like I said, its fine you can't force people to care back. My problem arose when I introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road I was very familiar with and didn't want her to go through, and she proceeded to ""Steal"" my bestest friends. I only say the world steal because she doesn't try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group. I'm just so angry and can't talk to her, she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now, and has just kind of shoved me to a curb. I find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because I was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up, and she knew I was lonely and super super happy when I made my supposed close friends. She is so fake with them, it doesn't make sense. For example, one of my friends was going through a rough time and I was helping him get through it, and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once. Yes, reader you are probably thinking to yourself, what's wrong with wanting to help people? And I would agree with you, there isn't anything wrong. But the thing is that she lacks consistency. She only tries to help when it is beneficial to her. Helping people is not in her personality, I spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye. Why care about my friend who I had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with? She literally had met him like twice?! I think I forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she didn't have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex...sounds sketchy af to me.... Point is, I haven't talked to her in two weeks, I just can't hang with my friends anymore, and everyone thinks I'm the bad guy. I myself don't know if I am the bad guy, my close friends from home think I have a right to be upset..am I the bad guy for being upset? What should I even do at this point? Some people told me I needed to find better friends since they don't take my feelings into consideration, but I don't want to be that bitch that is like you have to choose friends...I'm conflicted with that because loyalty in friendship is very important..idk please help I'm just so sad and mad"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster expresses feelings of anger, sadness, and being upset, which are common emotional states associated with depression. They mention being lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough breakup, which suggests a history of depressive episodes. The intense feelings of loneliness, feeling excluded from their own friend group, and the belief that they have been permanently damaged by their roommate's actions are also significant red flags for depression. These thoughts and emotions demonstrate a significant level of emotional distress and align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Friend is acting distant, not hanging out much, i don't know what to do. *Apologies ahead of time for the novel.* So i (M 30s) have been friends with my buddy (M 30s) for several years, and there seems to be a repeating pattern with him and i really don't know what to do when this happens. Instead of a long history, i'll just cite these last few months as an example. So as i said, we've known each other for quite a while. He's probably my best friend, although i wouldn't say i'm his (i'm not sure he really has one). But anyways, prior to the last couple months we were hanging out as we usually do. If we don't hang out every other day, we'd usually catch up over voice chat while playing video games, etc... And this is the normal routine for us, we'd talk or hang out at least every other day, if not more often. Then suddenly, a few weeks ago, it's like a switch went off and he's out. What i mean by that is since then, i may hear from him once a week for an hour or so, at best; sometimes longer. When we do chat, he mostly seems normal, but i can tell he's off. So i've asked him what he's been up to, what's going on in his life, you know the usuals, and i get the usual answers for him: work, playing video games, seeing his parents occasionally. I've brought up his absence and asked him what's going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, ""oh nothing"", ""i've just been avoiding everyone"", ""just doing my own thing"". I pressed a little harder a couple weeks back and got a jokingly put ""i guess i've got a serotonin imbalance, haha"". I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go. Next time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual ""meh"" or ""i dunno"". When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, ""you can stop fucking asking me about it"", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems. But of course there are, he's still MIA for weeks at a time. The thing is, this is a pattern with him. We're normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he's out and like this for weeks or a few months. Then as if another switch goes off, he's back on again and acts normal and as if nothing's happened. This has happened more times than i can count. You know i wouldn't be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he's doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together). But as far as i can tell he's just sitting alone by himself every night. I've considered the possibility he's depressed or bi-polar (although you'd never get him to admit that), in which case i don't know what to do if he won't talk to me about it. I've considered that perhaps i've done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i'm not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong. I've thought perhaps he's just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i've said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it's as if nothing's happened at all. So my problem is this. I don't know what to do when he's like this. I don't know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc. You know, he's my best friend, i'd like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what's really going on, well besides him just ""avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing"". He gets agitated if i push the issue. So how do i handle this? Is there a way to broach this"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does exhibit emotional indicators that suggest the poster may be experiencing some level of depression. The poster describes feeling confused and unsure about how to handle their friend's behavior, which suggests a sense of helplessness or being overwhelmed. The mention of their friend's avoidance of discussing feelings and their own openness about their own emotions suggests a contrast in coping mechanisms, potentially indicating a deeper emotional struggle for the poster. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of concern and frustration, as well as a fear of pushing their friend further away, which aligns with the emotional distress commonly associated with depression. However, without additional information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the depression or provide a definitive label."
"Consider this post: ""I wasn't supposed to live this long I tried to kill myself on my birthday, january 7th, but failed because i vomited up all of the drain cleaner I drank. They kept me in a psych ward for a week. I just came back home and it is kinda surreal given that i packed all my shit up and wrapped up most loose ends the only feeling I can compare this to is like beating an open-world game and just wandering around with nothing left to do. Honestly I am prepared to die but am not willing to overcome my instinctual fear of death again."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays strong indicators of severe depression. The poster expresses a history of attempted suicide and a desire for death. They describe feeling disconnected and lacking purpose, comparing it to the empty feeling after completing a video game.

"Consider this post: ""How to stop being friend with a person that i'm envious of ?? Hi... I'm a university student who befriend with a person who also study in the same university as me as well as enrolling in the same bachelor degree. When i befriend with this person, i just feel a lot of inconveniences and jealousy in my life. Honestly, i often feel envy of his high scores, actually sometimes i even help him to do an assignment (like sending him a copy of my assignment) which annoyingly also makes him get a higher score than me. He is a good guy, but i just really don't want to befriend with him anymore because of this kind of inconveniences and jealousy. I know, maybe some of you see me as the ""Toxic Friend"" or the ""Bad Guy"" here, but, i don't really care. The question is... How to stop being friend with this person in a gradual way ?? If i stop helping him in doing assignments, will it help me to break this friendship ??"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of envy and inconvenience, which can be signs of depression. The poster expresses feelings of jealousy towards their friend's academic success and acknowledges their own negative behavior, such as helping their friend with assignments despite it affecting their own grades. They also express a desire to end the friendship due to these negative emotions. This overall emotional state suggests a possible link to depression, as it involves feelings of inadequacy and a desire to distance oneself from others."
"Consider this post: ""I don't know if I am allowed to feel this way I don't have many friends to start with. I mean I do, but when I count close friends, I nearly have none as I am slowly starting to lose them. I have great friends, amazing friends that were always there for me in the past, but I just don't feel any of that anymore. And yes, I know I should be considerate that they are people that have a life of their own with school and family and all their homework, but I feel in a way neglect. I asked them for once if they wanted to hang out, but they reply with ""sorry I'm busy with homework"" but then I see that they were making a costume and having a photoshoot with some other friend which would have took hours of work. I know I shouldn't say anything and I should be forunate that they still consider me their prized friend however, I feel neglected. I feel as if they don't even care or want to even care about me anymore because I'm the one always chatting in the chat, but I get short replies back once in the blue moon. It makes me feel like they just stopped because they found someone else. On top of that, they calmed they were sick and I do believe that. They actually had initially told me that they wanted to give me a present for Christmas which is rare because they never really give me things (once on a blue moon maybe) and I only give gifts to them for their birthday. But now since they are sick, I have a feeling I'm going to be told ""no, sorry I am sick and need to relax after finals"" when they always go out with their other friends for these occasions no matter what. I want to say this again, but I feel that it is not right that I am feeling disappointed and neglected because a person is allowed to do what they want. I am not not allowed to tell them what to do as they have their own life and I wouldn't like that. But please, my request is may I have some advice about or further insight about what you guys could possibly be seeing in this situation? My point of view I feel is too biased because I already know the person and their habits and I have an emotional response to this."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays significant signs of emotional distress and potentially indicates depression. The poster expresses feelings of loneliness, stating that they do not have many close friends and that they are losing the ones they do have. They describe feeling neglected and as though their friends no longer care about them. These feelings of isolation and being unimportant can be indicative of depression. The poster also discusses feeling disappointed and neglected, which aligns with symptoms of depression such as low self-esteem and a lack of fulfillment in interpersonal relationships.

"Consider this post: ""I have never met or know what my real father looked like. That changed this week. Also I found out I have two more sisters. So, my wife's family is really into ancestry and tracing lineage all the way back they can. Because of this, my wife really wanted to do 23andme and, being the good husband I try to be, I got her kits as a gift. Fast forward to Monday, the day I got my reports back. I'm scrolling through, ooo'ing and aww'ing at the things I didn't know, and then I go to their DNA relative section. Now, my wife had a few 3rd or 4th cousins who did the kit as well. Not me. I had one half sister listed. I was immediately stunned, because I only knew my real father's name and this girl had his last name. After sending a few messages, we find out that, yes in fact, she is my other half-sister (I have a half-brother and two other half-sisters)! Not only that, but I have two other half-sisters! My whole world was turned upside down this week. Prior to this, I had no interest in finding or knowing my real father. But, after seeing his picture for the first time and seeing how my sisters revere him. I am considering it. ON TOP OF THAT, this whole turn of events is like a Lifetime movie plot. Sadly he was in a car accident last week and was in critical condition. Even if I wanted to reach out, I don't think now is a good time.

I don't my old hobbies. I don't like the people I used to like. I don't like anything. I don't care about anything. I feel empty. Like all the things that made me who I am is gone. I don't care.

No. I don't want to. I don't want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and can't. To want to care and you just can't. I've tried medication and therapy.

Now I'm at a new command. Ones that's actually very strict and now with problems like this there's actually bad repercussions for depression and shit so I asked someone I knew from my last command on what to do and he got a hold of someone here and shit blew up. I had chaplins calling me and a bunch of higher ups and I denied the chaplins talk because of my problems with the last one and I just went with a first class instead. Once again all they told me was how great the navy is and how my problems are just me being a pussy pretty much. Why doesn't any care about how we feel or how I feel.

"Consider this post: ""How do you get a job after over a year of unemployment? F early 20s. I never finished college, came home, and I've been so depressed that I haven't done anything since I left school in 2016. I'm a really hard worker and I've always been liked by my bosses, but I don't feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs I've had I kind of - just - abandoned. I would get to a point where I couldn't handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if I wanted to come back during a break from school and I would never call back. Now I'm in this weird limbo that I don't know how to get out of because I basically don't have any credentials or references and there's a massive gap in my resume that I can't explain.""

The statement ""easier to fall back in than to fight against it"" suggests a sense of resignation or feeling overwhelmed by the effort required to resist negative emotions or behaviors. This aligns with the characteristic of depression where individuals may feel trapped or powerless in the face of their difficulties."
"Consider this post: ""Ending a friendship - am I overreacting? I'm looking for advice from impartial people. To give a little background information, I recently went through a nasty split with my fiance of several years. My relationship with him, up until the dividing issue, was solid. I have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance. I feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post portrays a strong sense of emotional distress and betrayal. The poster describes feeling deeply hurt and betrayed by their best friend, who spread false and hurtful rumors about their relationship. The impact of these rumors on the poster's personal and professional life is significant, leading to workplace mockery and even blaming the end of the relationship on shallow reasons. The emotional response of feeling betrayed, wanting to cut off the friend from their life, and seeking advice on whether their reaction is justified indicates a high level of emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I probably ruined everything Tonight I ruined almost a year of work. My girlfriend of 12 years and I had a really rough 10 months, and I have been working really hard to build up our relationship. However, tonight my depression and an existential crisis got the best of me, and I made a stupid decision. I tried to steal a bunch of things from Walmart, but I got caught. Her sister is the manager, and was the one who caught me. I told my girlfriend and she didn’t say anything. I’m worried that I’m going to lose her. If I lose her, I’ll have nothing. I may as well not exist, because she is my only source of happiness. I know I don’t deserve her, but I need her desperately."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress and guilt. The poster admits to making a serious mistake driven by their depression and existential crisis. They express fear of losing their girlfriend, who they consider to be their only source of happiness and reason for existing.

"Consider this post: ""The world needs more ""lollipop moments"". Back in middle school, I was helping out at a sunday school, tutoring primary kids. There was this adorable little girl who was struggling to sing the right tunes of a hymn. Even though I have absolutely no musical background, I tried to help her get her vocals and lyrics right by singing the hymn together. Eventually, I told her to continue repeating it herself and that every practice is an improvement from the last. She would call me frequently just to sing her new hymns and I would challenge her to learn a new hymn every week, this routine went on for quite a while between ourselves... Fast forward to today, I'm currently a struggling undergrad students coping with depression and stress and well as deteriorating health due to extreme fatigue. Bad grades and crippling financial debt are the least of my concerns. Many days I would feel tired and unmotivated to do anything... and barely making it to lectures only to zone off. At days I would think of suicide as well. There was nobody I could turn to that I felt I could relate to or even understand me... It was not until a few days ago I received an email from the girl's mother, the girl was unfortunately diagnosed with an illness that made her lose up to 90% of her hearing. However, she was recently accepted to a prestigious musical academy, and sent me the audition tape of her performance thanking me for my encouragement. That song that she performed, was the very first hymn she struggled when I first came up to her. Knowing that the girl went through so much hardship just to chase the dream I stimulated her from her youth gave me so much hope at the darkest point of my life. Knowing that I had the capacity to influence a big change in a little girls life gave me the purpose to live. Even though I had to wait for 8 years for this news, it was worth it. TL;DR We all have the ability to give small act of kindness which goes a long way. From putting a smile on your face to giving away your coat to cover a pair of cold shoulders, dont underestimate the impact it has to them in the present and the future. What kind of ""lollipop moments"" do you have?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits clear indications of emotional distress and depression. The poster describes struggling with depression, stress, deteriorating health, extreme fatigue, and thoughts of suicide. These are significant symptoms commonly associated with depression and suggest a deep sense of emotional pain and hopelessness. The mention of feeling tired and unmotivated to do anything and barely making it to lectures also aligns with symptoms of depression, such as lack of motivation, energy, and difficulty concentrating. However, towards the end of the post, the poster shares a personal story that gave them hope and purpose, implying that they may have experienced a few moments of positivity amidst their struggles. Despite this glimmer of hope, the overall tone and content of the post strongly suggest a significant level of emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I don’t want to lose friendship of 10 years but I think it’s going that way Hi guys, I don’t usually do this but I literally feel like I have nowhere else to vent. Ok. I have been friends with this person for 10 years since we were teenagers. We both clicked over time through going to the same school and I really liked her personality. We ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and I let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to. After graduation she’s spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much, though we have met up when she’s been back. So the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but it’s been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didn’t want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didn’t reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if she’s busy and have stressed to her that I don’t want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and it’s basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding. The thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I can’t think of anything. I have questioned whether I’m getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that she’s suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldn’t be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other. But if for some mysterious reason she’s cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can I do? I basically sent her a message saying I wouldn’t try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that. I feel like I may never hear from her again and it really hurts. But what can I do? If something isn’t there anymore then it’s just not there. - A 20 something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of hurt and disappointment in the potential loss of a long-term friendship. The poster expresses confusion and frustration over their friend's sudden lack of communication and seeks to understand if they have done something to upset her. There is a mention of feeling hurt and missing the friend, but it does not display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The overall tone of the post seems more focused on relationship dynamics and potential resolutions rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Well, it's been a year now since I tried killing myself A year ago on December 1st I tried to kill myself. I spent a week in a psych ward and have been on lots of meds and doing lots of therapy since then. The therapy has helped quite a bit, I've slowly learned how to listen to myself and how to take things one day at a time. As far as meds go, my anxiety is much more controllable and my sleeping meds actually work (mostly) so I can't complain too much. I don't think I'm ever going to overcome depression. I've kind of learned to live with it, sure, but beating it probably won't happen; I'm way too cynical to beat it. It's just how I'm wired. There's a lot in life I probably won't get to experience because of how I am. And I still don't know how to change that, or at least make some good out of it. I guess what I'm trying to say with this post is, I'm not sure if I'm happy or not. It's the not knowing that bugs me. I know I'm better than I was a year ago, but I still feel lost, and I don't know where to go from here. Every day is just a haze that I trot through. Sorry for the rambling. Have a good night"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals a history of suicide attempts, which is a strong indicator of severe depression. The poster mentions being in therapy and taking medication, indicating ongoing treatment for their mental health. Despite some improvement in anxiety and sleep, they express a belief that they will never overcome depression and have learned to live with it. This suggests a sense of hopelessness and resignation, typical of severe depression. They also mention feeling lost and unsure of their happiness, indicating a lack of pleasure or fulfillment in their life. The overall tone of the post is one of despair, self-doubt, and emotional fog, indicating a significant level of emotional distress consistent with severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""why is it so hard to make money but easy for others? reading success stories on reddit, it sounds like everyone is a millionaire."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and a comparison between the poster's difficulties in making money and the apparent ease of others. This suggests a feeling of inadequacy and possibly low self-worth, which can be indicators of depression. The mention of reading success stories on Reddit and perceiving everyone as a millionaire could also contribute to feelings of hopelessness or envy, further supporting the possibility of depression. Overall, the post highlights negative emotions and a negative perception of oneself, indicating a potential presence of depression."
"Consider this post: """"I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either."" Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace. I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful. The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said ""alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?"" I'd say ""no thanks, I'm good"". With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole. I should stop before I become some combination of ""old man yells at cloud"" and ""whiny emo stereotype"". This stuff sits on me every day and I wish the small part of me that wants the affirmation of others wasn't there. But it is, so here I am."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a deep sense of emptiness and lack of meaning in life, describing a perpetual feeling of weight and a gravitational pull that prevents them from wanting anything meaningful. They state that they simply don't want to exist, regardless of their current circumstances or potential future opportunities. The post also highlights a belief that their lack of desire for a fulfilling career, romantic relationships, or parenthood makes them unworthy of pursuing these aspects of life. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-deprecation, and the desire for affirmation from others aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."

"Consider this post: ""Still recovering from ex-girlfriend To preface this, I’m sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship. A little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more. After the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldn’t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now. 3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still aren’t friends anymore) and we’ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. Unfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriend’s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and don’t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldn’t matter but it still bothers me. I’ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again. I guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. I’m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that I’ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I can’t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. I’ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I can’t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now. I’m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a significant amount of emotional distress and despair.

"Consider this post: ""I've never felt more alone in my life and I don't know what to do about it. I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move. I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore. I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship.

"Consider this post: ""My Story - There is hope. **TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.** Hi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff ""you're so young,"" ""you'll grow out of it,"" ""go see a therapist/take medication,"" etc., I thought I'd share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone. **How Depression Affected Me**\- trigger warning It finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you don’t even know what’s you and what’s the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because it’s so familiar. We’re taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain isn’t real? In college, I was so afraid of being alone that I wouldn't want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I'd beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I didn't have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was 'enjoying' my college experience and 'exploring' my sexuality. I thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I didn't understand why I was the only one that couldn't cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it didn't even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends. Even though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I couldn't admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I don't think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point. The first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I didn't want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I couldn't sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year.

I’m a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i'd love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i'm overreacting? So, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that's kind of a given, right? But that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me. Here is when the bs started. . So, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled. So, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn't particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i've always had this ""thing"", where i have to run my fingers through someone's hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully. How? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn't sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she'd come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again. We later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom. Come to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked. I kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born. Sadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma. Now, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports. So, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn't do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a ""Participant"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

I’m going to do that at our next appointment. My question now is about telling my boyfriend. He knows I have depression and anxiety. I don’t want him to worry more than he already does. At the same time, though, I might need the extra support. He probably already knows anyway.... What should I do and how should I do it? I know I can get through this. I’ve done it before, so I really don’t want him to worry. Any thoughts?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses significant distress, as the poster mentions having suicidal thoughts and seeking advice on whether or not to disclose this to their boyfriend. This indicates a level of emotional pain and vulnerability that aligns with symptoms of depression. The poster also acknowledges their existing depression and anxiety, which further supports the idea that they may be experiencing depression. The tone of the post reflects a sense of uncertainty and a desire for guidance, suggesting that the poster may be struggling to cope with their emotional state. Overall, the post conveys emotional distress and a need for support, which is characteristic of depression."
"Consider this post: ""I have a friend who mentioned she wants to make new friends and when I made suggestions like getting a job would help her make some friends, she said she doesn't need my help or advice. Why would she bring it up if she didn't want some sort of reaction/ advice from me?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not display strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily focuses on a specific situation with a friend and expressing confusion about their behavior. While there may be a slight sense of disappointment or frustration, it does not prominently exhibit the deep emotional pain, exhaustion, or hopelessness typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking understanding and figuring out the friend's intentions rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Just found out my family’s opinion of me. I walked by the kitchen and they were all talking about what a loser I am. My mom was leading the “discussion”. Everyone was involved except my dad. I told my dad what was going on and he went off on them. I’m just in my room thinking about how hurt I am. Especially considering I’ve been doing all my moms chores for her. Pretty much doing everything she should do. The only person who came to my defense was my dad. I told him I’m going to move out and he told me he wants me to stay. I think what really hurts is it feels like my whole family is against me. After hearing what they said, I kind of hate them. I think I need to get away from this situation. But I have literally have no one else."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys feelings of hurt, betrayal, and frustration as a result of the poster discovering their family's negative opinion of them. The poster describes how their mom and other family members were talking negatively about them, which has caused them emotional pain. However, there are no strong indicators of the profound hopelessness, despair, or lack of enjoyment typically associated with very severe depression. The poster expresses a desire to move out and feelings of hatred towards their family, but this could be a natural response to the negative situation they are experiencing rather than a manifestation of depression. Additionally, the poster acknowledges having their dad's support and indicates that they have no one else, suggesting that they do have some form of social support. Overall, while the post conveys emotional distress, it does not provide enough evidence to suggest very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Something my dad said has been bothering me So a while back I decided to make some french onion soup for the first time. I don't cook very often and I'm not that good at it, so when I made the soup it seemed to turn out pretty good. I was kinda proud of my attempt and wanted my dad to try it to see what he thought of it. I brought him a small bowl to try it, and I know he was joking but it really hurt my feelings. He says to me as I hand the bowl to him, ""It's not poison is it?"" What do you guys think? Do you think it was just harmless joking? Or do you think he thinks I would actually do something horrible like that?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is bothered by something their dad said. The poster describes feeling hurt and unsure about whether the comment was harmless or indicative of their dad's beliefs about them. While this does show some emotional distress, it does not reach the level commonly associated with very severe depression. The post does not mention any other symptoms of depression or display a pervasive sense of hopelessness, numbness, or exhaustion. The focus of the post is on seeking opinions and interpretations of the situation, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain or a lack of enjoyment in life."
"Consider this post: ""Should I cut her off finally? Been knowing bestie since we were 14 (now 30), we've been through a lot blah blah. In the past year or so, I've sensed she sort of feels envy or jealousy, not sure which. Things like being short in messages (HATE this), not reciprocating advice when I always do (I got accepted into university and she barely acknowledged, just like to hear support sometimes, and then proceeds to try to enroll sooner at same school and tells me, expecting congratulatory response of course, or even advice over guys), being overly aggressive and controlling when she drinks (have cut back going out A LOT due to this); so any who, I don't want to lose her but am at point in my life where I don't want any negativity, she's been through a lot, and sometimes I feel she needs me more than I need her. I'm stuck but gearing towards letting her go, but just unsure, maybe I'm overreacting? :("" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The main concern expressed is whether or not to cut off a best friend. While the poster mentions feeling unsure, doubtful, and possibly overreacting, there is no overwhelming sense of hopelessness or despair. The tone of the post feels more conflicted and unsure rather than deeply distressed."
"Consider this post: ""Realising your mental state and life is unfixable sucks Just started to realise this. Been working my way to suicide last year but it didn't work out. So I'm trying my best (how ironic) to just feed myself everyday, and not letting my emotions burden the ones I love (or any person I come across). Basically just existing plainly. I really wished I could show affection to those I love and care about. But I realise that without any qualities as a person, I'm better off just not being a nuisance and a liability. Feeling lonely sucks. I wished I feel loved by those whom I love. But staying away (while not killing myself) is my only way to protect them from myself. Oh well. Thanks for listening."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a profound sense of hopelessness, despair, and self-loathing. The poster discusses their past suicide attempt and the ongoing struggle to maintain basic self-care. They express a belief that they lack qualities as a person and see themselves as a burden and liability to those they love. The mention of feeling lonely and wanting to feel loved further emphasizes the emotional distress they are experiencing. The overall tone of the post reflects a deep sense of emotional pain and a resignation to their current state, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Is this friendship normal, and have I done the right thing? Hi everyone, I am a guy, 19 years old and I live in the Netherlands. A long time ago I managed to become friends with a 16 year old girl who lives in Spain. I already went to visit her once and we are/were very close. She is bisexual and has a 15 year old girlfriend who lives 450 kilometers away from her. I also talk a lot with that girlfriend. All friendships come with fights, but recently nothing that she does makes sense anymore. It all started when her grandma passed away 6 months ago. She was really close with her, even more then with her parents. Apart from her grandma, sister, her aunt and 2 classmates and me, nobody knows she is dating a girl. She got very depressed when her grandma died. She was barely happy, she started to get nightmares, she started cutting, and recently she says she also talks with a demon. She keeps saying stuff like ''only my girlfriend can save me'' and ''only my girlfriend can heal my wounds'' this resulted in that her girlfriend is talking with her almost daily for hours while that girlfriend actually has to study. When her girlfriend didn't pass her exams this year, the girlfriend got the blame for it. While instead she was the one claiming all of her time so that she could be 'fixed'. This fight caused her to feel even worse and she started to look at video's how to commit suicide and she started to send photo's to her girlfriend of her cuts. This is not something she told me directly, but I heard everything through her girlfriend who was very scared at this point. One evening she said ''tonight I am going to end my life''. At that moment I contacted her sister and told her everything. Her sister was shocked and assured me she would watch over her. One day she found out that I told her sister when she broke into her phone. She was very angry at me and started making insults and threatened me to end the friendship. Recently she is going to a psychologist and psychiatrist because her sister passed everything on to her parents. They are trying to help her but it doesn't really work so far. Also in the last 3 weeks her phone was taken by her parents because she wasn't doing her choirs and was always angry. In that time I only talked to her girlfriend in private on whatsapp, not in the group of us 3. And after a week she stole the phone for a moment from her parents and got furious at me saying I should not talk to her girl in a private chat. Only in the groupchat. I did so to stop it from getting worse. Talking for 3 weeks to her girlfriend was loads of fun. Silly texts, talk about all kinds of random stuff and I helped her with some questions on her homework. In those 3 weeks all of her grades went up. And she passed one exam after the other. It was amazing and she thought the same. 2 days ago she got her phone back and the first thing she said was that she was going to make a list of rules for me. If I don't obey those rules she will break the friendship. Some of those rules are: - Don't talk to my girlfriend in private - You are not allowed to visit my girlfriend if I'm not there too - Tell me everything that you are doing every day - If I'm busy talking with my girl, don't disturb us under any circumstances. I was really angry. I still am. I told her that I don't have any feelings for her girlfriend and that I would never do something to her on purpose. She just doesn't listen. Her girlfriend is also tired of her but she can't say no to her and she doesn't want to break up. I have some questions: - Is this normal? - Is it normal what she is doing? - What should her girlfriend do? - Did I do the right thing by telling her sister about her suicide thought, cutting, anxiety, demons and nightmares? It almost costed me my friendship with her."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed by their friend's behavior and expresses concern for their well-being. They mention their friend's depression, self-harming behavior, and thoughts of suicide, as well as a belief in talking with a demon. This indicates a significant level of emotional distress and possible psychotic symptoms. The poster also mentions their own anger and frustration with the situation, which can be associated with depression. The overall tone of the post suggests a deep sense of worry, helplessness, and confusion, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""I dropped an internet friend several months ago and I regret it. I met her like almost 3 years ago. We were very close internet friends and would talk basically every day. She was amazing. In real life i had basically no friends. She was the only friend I had. I'm sure this led me to having unhealthy views on relationships. I still have unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships. Anyways, the trouble began when on instagram, our main chatting platform, she began to gain friends from just common interests and such. She started posting screenshots of her friends and her dm conversations and how funny they were. She then would post screenshots of her group chat conversations and how funny they were. All of this would happen, and I would still be waiting for a simple reply. I didn't get it. I still don't really get it. I was there for her for so long. She didn't have many friends in real life or online either. But once she had gotten these new internet friends she would ignore me? She would reply up to three or four days later. She also made a whole separate account where she would post as well which she never even told me about and I had to find out myself when she spoke about it on her main account. I finally had enough and sent her a long explanation about my feelings and stuff and didn't speak to her after that. And the funny thing is that she didn't reply to my explanation for two weeks. And suddenly she was like "":( nooo pls :(("" etc Typing all of this, I lowkey am getting annoyed.. I just want someone to smack some sense into me. Like it's been so long and I still think about her. It wasn't like she was a bad friend, but she just fuckin ignored me and basically left me. I usually think about her when I'm feeling lonely or my irl best friend starts to treat me like shit and ignores me.. but that's a different story... Right now, I'm thinking about dming her and just having small talk. I feel like it's a bad idea, but also it could reunite us and we could be friends again? It's probably a bad idea and I probably won't do it though.. Please give me words of wisdom."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, loneliness, and regret. The poster describes feeling hurt and ignored by their internet friend, which has caused them to question their own views on relationships. The mention of feeling lonely and turning to thoughts of reconnecting with their friend as a way to alleviate that loneliness suggests a longing for connection and a lack of fulfillment in their current relationships. The overall tone of sadness, frustration, and longing for someone to provide guidance or support indicates a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Getting all excited to do something and then canceling at the last moment, for no reason (or: How to Let Down Six Online Acquaintances With One Easy Trick) Last week I set up an online gaming event that was supposed to take place today. It didn't get a whole lot of interest relative to the other things on the forum, but I happened to have scheduled it very close to another event without realizing, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯, whatcha gonna do. Either way it was enough interest to follow through with it, so fast forward to today... ...When I had to write a very apologetic post four minutes before it was due to start, deflecting to some bullshit like ""personal stress + shitty time management."" And just like that, I had disappointed everyone involved. Idk, it doesn't sound like much when it's written down, but it's been a while since I've done a last minute cancellation quite that bad, and I've just been left feeling really guilty about the whole thing."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays emotions of guilt, disappointment, and self-criticism, which are commonly associated with depression. The poster expresses excitement and anticipation for an online gaming event, but then cancels it at the last moment with a sense of regret. The language used, such as ""letting down,"" ""apologetic,"" and ""feeling really guilty,"" suggests a negative self-perception and a tendency to put oneself down. This level of self-blame and negative emotions aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The post also mentions personal stress and poor time management, which can be indicative of underlying emotional struggles that are contributing to the poster's actions and feelings."

I've been sick of it.. since 2012. I deleted facebook and twitter in 2012 (the worst ones imo) BUTtt.. I kept instagram since then and added snapchat all so that society and my friends and people I would meet in the future would not judge me for not having any social media.. hah.

I'll always see people I dislike even if I block them because a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend always pops up with them on my feed :) Absolutely hate this shit now.

Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of despair, frustration, and self-loathing in response to social media. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed by constant updates and the comparisons they make between their own life and the seemingly perfect lives of others. There is a clear lack of enjoyment or fulfillment from engaging with social media and a desire to escape it altogether. The language used, including phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and ""shut up,"" indicates a significant level of emotional distress and hopelessness that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression.

"Consider this post: ""Best friend of 7 years dropped me like nothing. So I'm in an LDR, and my boyfriend came to visit where I live for the first time. It was our second meeting so we were so happy to be together. So I took him to meet my best friend who had supported me in my relationship because she had a similar situation going on. After my visit with him at her house, I asked if we could go over again the next night and she told me no because I third wheeled her in her own house. However, I don't feel we did that because we weren't affectionate around her and her parents were in the room as well. A little after he left I apologize to her even though I didn't feel I had done anything wrong. Recently, she has deleted me off most social media platforms and if Imma be honest... I don't care. Yes. I miss having the girl companion, having another girl to talk to about things. But, I don't want a friend that isn't a true friend. Who just dumps 7 years of friendship over feeling like a 3rd wheel. I think there was a jealousy element to it but I'll never know. Because I'm not chasing her, she's gotta come to me. I'm don't chasing her"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays some emotional distress related to the loss of a long-term friendship. The poster expresses disappointment and confusion over their best friend abruptly cutting them off and details the events leading up to the rift. They acknowledge missing the companionship of a female friend but also assert their own self-worth and unwillingness to chase after someone who is not a true friend. While there is some emotional impact from the situation, the overall tone does not indicate a severe level of depression. The post focuses more on asserting personal boundaries and valuing oneself rather than exhibiting the hopelessness and despair commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""My latest addiction for pain relief Cannabis and prescriptions weren't doing enough so I added gay sex with men to my regiment. I'm not even attracted to men. I just enjoy being sought after like a prize, and the way that these guys appreciate my body when I'm with them. Usually I just get massaged/played with for an hour and then give a bj in return. Feels amazing to have another human be all over me even though I can't ejaculate. If you feel like you've given up and don't care about anything, give this a try. If you truly don't care then you'll at least get to feel the comforting touch of another human."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits signs of very severe depression. The individual describes using different substances and engaging in casual sexual encounters with men as a way to numb their emotional pain and feel wanted. They mention not being attracted to men and only participating in these activities for the physical and emotional connection it provides. This suggests a lack of self-worth and a desperate need for validation and comfort. The mention of not caring about anything and feeling like they have given up further emphasizes the severity of their emotional distress, which aligns with symptoms commonly seen in individuals with depression."

The author describes contemplating life and death, feeling that neither holds any appeal. They express a belief that nothing matters and that they don't have any value or meaning.

"Consider this post: ""My friend is ruining her frienships I'm not really sure what to do here. My best friend, let's call her Sam, has lost a lot of friendships recently. And I mean a lot. In the past two years, she's lost almost every close friendship she's ever had. The count is in the double digits. Something would happen and she'd declare them dead to her and never speak to them again. Unfortunately, I find myself usually feeling like it's Sam's fault that the friendships are crumbling. Recently, she's started shamelessly using her friends. One girl worked as a seamstress at a community theater in her free time and Sam would constantly arrive unannounced and drop off clothes she wanted tailored, imposing absurd timeline, even saying she'd be back that night to pick the dresses up. When her friend finally asked Sam to start paying, Sam announced to everyone that their friendship was over and that she refused to associate with someone who didn't view her as a friend. She's started yelling at people for not texting her more. She called one of her now former friends, an elementary school teacher, and yelled at her for not responding to her texts about where they were going to get dinner that night. She wanted to make sure she didn't eat the same type of food for lunch. The teacher cancelled and they haven't spoken since. And unfortunately, with each new friend lost, her demands on those remaining have become more and more extreme. Her need for attention has gotten out of hand. She demands that we all hang out four nights a week and constantly accuses people of not valuing her friendship enough if they can't make it. One friend spent every night with her one week trying to show Sam that she mattered. When the friend didn't continue that schedule the next week, Sam screamed at them for pulling away and called her a coward for not just ending it if she didn't want to be friends. Worst of all, she accuses people of saying things they've never said, claiming that she's stupid, she can read between the lines. And when people try to explain that they never intended to hurt or upset her, she claims that it doesn't matter what they said. What matters is how she was made to feel. It shouldn't come as a surprise that Sam has serious self-esteem issues. She's in therapy and has been for a while, trying to work on them. Unfortunately, she goes back and forth between crying that no one knows how hard it is to live with ""being such a failure"" and accusing others of not being deserving of her friendship. I want to be there for her. I want to help. She's been my best friend and she used to be able to be there for me, but I'm not sure I can handle who she's become and how she's started treating us. tl;dr: My friend has serious self-esteem issues and is ruining all of her friendships because she treats everyone like absolute garbage. She's getting therapeutic help but I'm not sure I'm able to stick around long enough for things to get better."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates a significant concern for a friend who is experiencing a pattern of losing friendships due to their behaviors and demands. The poster describes how their friend has become increasingly manipulative, demanding, and emotionally volatile. The mention of serious self-esteem issues, therapy, and conflicting emotions about continuing to support their friend suggests a level of emotional distress and difficulty in managing their friendship that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to handle the situation indicates a significant level of emotional distress that could be linked to depression."
"Consider this post: ""When did you decide to get help? What was the tipping point?

I don’t want to go into a lot of detail or get really personal but for context I’m a college senior. I went to a psychiatrist when I was young (like 7 or 8) and I took medicine for depression but they made me aggressive according to my mom so I didn’t take them long. I haven’t seen anyone, including a school counselor, since then. However in late high school/early college I struggled with self harm. These days I just feel so tired and empty and I just want to sleep."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators that suggest the poster may be suffering from depression. They mention feeling happy on some days but experiencing difficult nights and days, indicating a fluctuation in mood. The mention of struggling with self-harm in the past is a strong indicator of emotional distress. The feelings of tiredness, emptiness, and a desire to sleep are also consistent with symptoms of depression. Additionally, the reluctance to get into personal details and the mention of not seeking help since childhood indicate a potential reluctance or hesitancy in seeking professional help, which is also common among individuals with depression."

The poster specifically mentions feeling ""super low,"" which suggests a significant level of emotional distress.

NY. around so many people i feel like a lost soul. &amp; it don’t seem like anyone understands me. so i still feel... different... i started typing about my childhood but that’s a story in itself so i’ll keep it to my more recent years. suicide.. it’s growing on me everyday. just for the simple fact that i think myself into this mood where i think everyone’s life would be easier without me around. not to toot my own horn but i’m pretty popular, so i know people would be affected by it for a couple days but who really CARES enough to actually help my mind get to a better place? i’ve seen it happen plenty of times in this place i call home. i have had the same friends for 10+ years, very authentic friends but i feel we’re outgrowing each other.. youngest kid to a very loving hard working single mother of 3 but i always felt like the odd child.. &amp; currently in a 2 year relationship with a girl anyone would want.. (i recently started blaming her for cheating from thinking too much) but yet, i don’t feel not even half complete. i shut down &amp; don’t talk to those who mean most to me to the point where they think i have a problem with them... &amp; i don’t know how to control it. i was never able to talk to a counselor or mentor cause i never felt real love from them. but sometimes i think i just need a open ear i can vent to without everyone else knowing about it. that seems to never happen though. not to sound like a hippy, loll but i live my life off of vibes, if you know what i mean.. &amp; as of late i don’t even know what a vibe is. i just want to be left alone to think. recently deleted all social media accounts, just isolating myself from my surroundings.. i feel like everything is coming to an end soon. idk. i just need that push. i don’t want to be a waste of life when it’s all said &amp; done."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feeling like a lost soul and feeling different from others, which often indicates a deep sense of isolation and disconnection. They mention that thoughts of suicide are growing on them, which is significant and suggests a high level of distress and hopelessness. They express the belief that others would be better off without them and mention shutting down and isolating themselves from loved ones. These feelings of emptiness, self-blame, and difficulty controlling their emotions are all consistent with symptoms of very severe depression. The mention of deleting social media accounts and isolating themselves further suggests withdrawal and a lack of interest in engaging with the world, which is also a common symptom of depression. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, and a desire for support and understanding."
"Consider this post: ""I'm going to stop eating. I've been trying to fill the void by eating junk food. Long ago when I was healthy my family knew me for my big appetite. My family doesn't listen to me. Maybe they'll finally notice and finally try for me when I've stopped eating all together. Maybe I'll lose weight too, I don't care if it's just water weight. I drink a ton of water anyway. I just don't care."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and despair. The poster expresses a desire to stop eating as a way to cope with the emotional void they are feeling. They also mention that their family does not listen to them, indicating a feeling of being unheard and unsupported. The mention of wanting their family to finally notice and try for them suggests a longing for validation and attention. The lack of concern for losing weight, even if it's just water weight, suggests a distorted perception of body image or self-worth. Overall, the post reflects significant emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""My son is married to a Mexican and I don’t like it I raised him to have traditional white European values and to be proud of his race and heritage, I was always convinced he took this on board, but I hadn’t seen my son in three years after an disagreement, so I checked his Facebook and I saw pictures of him on his wedding day with a Mexican as a bride and I almost fainted I was so upset, I feel utterly betrayed, I just found this out yesterday and I don’t know how to confront him, I think it’s really gross that he lays with a mud skinned woman in bed every night, I wanted white grandchildren I could love, but if he has kids with this thing I want nothing to do with them, I feel so utterly betrayed, what should I do?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays xenophobic and racist sentiments towards the son's choice of partner, expressing a strong sense of betrayal and disgust. However, the focus of the post is not on the poster's own emotional distress or feelings of depression. While the content of the post is highly concerning and reflects prejudiced beliefs, it does not provide clear evidence of the emotional symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post is more anger and disappointment rather than profound sadness or hopelessness."
"Consider this post: ""So tired I lost my job in Feb. of this year. I have been on unemployment since and watching my son while i look for work. Well, thats about exhausted, then my water heater broke, then my only grandpa passed away suddenly. I thought i had something good going with a little media company with my long time friend, but that fell through. Now the engine in my care is locked up because of an oil leak i apparently didnt know about. If i dont find something soon it will all be up to my wife and she simply cant do it on her paycheck alone. It is all so tiring. Anytime i get a step ahead i cant help but get knocked back a dozen. I dont know what im doing anymore. I dont even know why im doing this right now. i fucking hate money."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional exhaustion and despair. The poster describes a series of unfortunate events and setbacks they have experienced, including losing their job, dealing with financial difficulties, and the passing of a loved one. They express a feeling of constant struggle, getting knocked back every time they make progress. The mention of not knowing what they are doing anymore and a strong expression of hatred towards money indicates a deep sense of hopelessness and frustration. The overall tone of the post reflects significant emotional distress and aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""[F17] I really need someone to listen This is a throw-away, because I don't want anyone in my personal life to see this. Let me preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you can't diagnose bipolar disorder until you're 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I've struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i've been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it's starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I'm completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I'm not hungry unless I smoke and I can't fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I can't go to college, because I can't afford it and my mom says she can't consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she'd be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I'm just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I can't. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They've both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doesn't bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I don't care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she's gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom couldn't do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I've never had to cope with someone dying before, and it's so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people's, but I'm so sad right now. I don't know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to go down that road again. I just don't know how to cope anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain, despair, and hopelessness. The poster describes a history of mental health diagnoses including severe depression, bipolar tendencies, chronic anxiety, and body dysmorphia. They express a long history of struggling with self-harm and a previous suicide attempt. The mention of being clean for a year and being on medication indicates some improvement, but the poster describes a recent decline in their mental health. They also discuss unhealthy coping mechanisms such as dependency on marijuana and express feelings of sadness and frustration about not being able to afford college and feeling trapped in their current situation. The mention of their parents' conflicts, potential job loss, and addiction issues adds to their overall emotional distress. The loss of their dog and their difficulty coping with death further contributes to their profound emotional pain. The post exhibits many symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression, including thoughts of suicide and a sense of hopelessness and lack of coping mechanisms."
"Consider this post: ""Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements. Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc. Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption. Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen. I may have butchered a lot of this vitamin D thing so please take the time to read this: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201307/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-depression If you need anything, message me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits a concern for the well-being of others and provides advice on taking Vitamin D supplements as a potential solution for improving mood and stability. While the tone of the post is helpful and supportive, there are subtle indications of emotional distress. The mention of needing to keep the mind stimulated without an electronic screen may suggest difficulty in finding enjoyment or fulfillment. Additionally, the offer to message for support implies a level of empathy and understanding that may stem from personal experience with depression. Overall, although the post is informative and supportive, there are underlying hints of emotional struggle and empathy that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Lost and Alone Hi, I’m 19 and I’m at my low point. Up until last year my life was pretty good, but now everything has fallen apart and I have no clue where to start picking up the pieces... I’ll keep it short, but I found out my parents were getting divorced when I came home from college on spring break. I don’t have a lot of friends and no close friends to confide in. The only people I do talk to are leaving for college soon (I’m staying home now) and the only thing I had left was my girlfriend who cheated on me. I know I’m young and I’ll grow from this but I’m lost and I don’t know what to do.."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of deep sadness, loneliness, and being at a low point. The poster describes significant life events that have led to a sense of everything falling apart, including their parents' divorce and their girlfriend cheating on them. The lack of close friends or support systems exacerbates the feelings of being lost and not knowing what to do. The post highlights a sense of hopelessness and confusion about how to move forward from this difficult situation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I want a cat so much due to depression and loneliness... I once had a cat I had got for my 16th birthday over 10 years ago before she died at a bit of a young age just almost a year ago. She helped me so much whenever I had suicidal thoughts; when I would get them and tell myself how much I should die, I would think of her, and then ask myself ""Who would take care of her? She would be so devastated if her own master was gone. I could never do that to her."" But ever since her death, I think I've been more depressed and lonely without her. I've been so much more angry and isolated, I think. I want a furry companion so, so much, but I don't think it will happen anytime soon, no matter how urgent or how much I rather need one, and that makes me even more depressed. There's been so much going on, so it's not a good time to look for a kitten; however, the thing is, I don't know how much longer I have to wait, and I don't know how much longer I \*can\* wait, because my family moved, and the house we live in is being renovated, so I don't even have a room yet. My wild guess is that it could take maybe a year for everything to settle, but I cannot wait that long at all before getting a cat. I'm torn. Should I just get a cat for the sake of my health, or should I endure the wait a little longer so things can settle down a bit more?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of depression and loneliness. The poster describes how their previous cat provided them with emotional support and prevented them from acting on suicidal thoughts. The loss of their cat has intensified their feelings of depression, anger, and isolation. They express a strong desire for a furry companion to help alleviate their emotional distress, but also describe barriers such as the current renovation of their house and uncertainty about how long they can wait. The poster's desperation and conflict between getting a cat for their health and waiting for more stable conditions suggest a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Feeling sad for my daughter/realizing grandparents won't live forever My husband and I had a child later in life. She's 18 months old and her grandparents on both sides are in their mid-late 60's. My parents are very healthy and I don't think of them as ""old"", so I mentioned that my daughter could live close to them if she chose to go to University in the city where they live. My mom chimed up and said that they may both be dead by then (for context, they're Chinese and it's completely normal for them to be this blunt with their children). I've had other family members pass away before, but it just hit me that no matter how you prepare yourself for that day, you'll never be ready to say goodbye. It's never enough time. I immediately felt very sad for my young daughter and just hope that we have lots of time left to bond and make memories. We live 5 hours away by car, so it's hard to see them as regularly as we'd like, but we try to visit and have them visit as often as we can. I just hope she gets to spend as much time as possible with them."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While the poster does express feeling sad about the realization that their parents won't live forever and their desire for their daughter to spend as much time as possible with them, it does not convey a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair. The emotions expressed seem to align more with a natural concern and love for their family rather than a symptom of depression."
"Consider this post: ""drugs are the only thing that make me feel okay i’ve done everything under the sun to try and help myself. counseling, confiding in anyone who will listen, taken all different types of medication, and the only thing that has ever made me feel okay is not being sober. idc what it is i’ll do it. i fucking hate being sober. i just want to get fucked up and lay in bed and watch shit on my laptop and i literally have no reason to be so depressed but the only thing that helps is drugs. not looking for moral support or anything i just need to vent without being looked down on and judged. thx"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong reliance on drugs as the only thing that provides relief or makes the poster feel okay. They mention trying various other methods such as counseling and medication, but none of them have been effective. The language used, such as ""fucking hate being sober"" and the desire to ""get fucked up,"" suggests a high level of frustration and desperation. The poster states that they have no reason to be depressed, indicating a potential disconnect between their emotional state and their perception of their life circumstances. The overall tone conveys a sense of hopelessness and a need for a non-judgmental outlet to vent, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I feel depressed and ashamed of what just happened? My father died a few years and I’m living with his widow who has also been my stepmother for three years, since I was 16. I came home from a night out with the lads and I will admit that I had been drinking and doing a bit of coke, my stepmother got all in my face calling me a junkie and I pushed her, we then got into a physical altercation and we ended up on the sofa with me on top of her, she spat in my face and I head butted her, she then said “do you like hitting women, does it make you feel like a man, go on why don’t you fuck me if you want to be a man” and she lifted up her dress and I almost went through with it, but I said to her “you disgust me” and I walked off and had a wank in the sink instead. I feel confused, but I also got so turned on, what should I do?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: This response seems inappropriate and insensitive given the nature of the post. The post describes a deeply distressing and disturbing situation involving physical altercations and abusive behavior. It is important to approach such posts with empathy, compassion, and a focus on safety. It is inappropriate to label the poster as suffering from depression based on this post alone. Instead, they may be in need of advice, support, or professional help to address the complex issues and emotions expressed in the post."
"Consider this post: ""Scared of my mother, because of fear of jocasta complex Ok, this all started pretty normally, mum was worried about me being suicidal and hugging me. But then, something happened, she spooned me, at 1:30 am. saying she had to feel my hearbeat, knowing Full well I sleep naked. and she keeps going into my bed, uninvited, spooning me, saying creepy obsessive things. Even though my depression is getting better. So I am scared of her. Being in the same room gets me into a stuttering mess, and I just don't know what to do. It keeps me up at night TL:DR Scared of my mum fucking me, and it's worrying me a lot"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster is exhibiting signs of severe distress and discomfort. The post describes a disturbing and inappropriate behavior from the mother, which has caused fear and anxiety in the poster. The poster's mention of being in a ""stuttering mess"" and feeling scared in the same room as their mother suggests a high level of distress and emotional unease. The overall tone of the post is one of worry and concern, indicating a significant emotional impact from the situation described. While the post does not explicitly mention depression, the fear and anxiety expressed align with symptoms commonly associated with it."
"Consider this post: ""I am always wrong.. I got married with a wrong man. I have been married for 5 years. I have a baby who is still a month. I realized that i chose the wrong person as husband. He ruined my life. He ruined my inside. He cheats on me while i was pregnant. But he does not think he did bad things to me. When i said something, he always says that I'm stupid or crazy. He thinks he's right. Since last year, we moved to his country and living with his mother and sister. Because he works there. His family are nice to me. But my husband doesn't come back every day.. I have a baby but he doesn't support me. I haven't realized he's such a bad man.. He has hidden so many things from me.. So i thought he's a good husband. But he brought financial issues. And i have helped it. But he forgot that.. I want to leave him but i don't have money and i have a baby.. And I'm in different country.. No one is by my side. I cut myself almost every day. I have stopped it since i was 20. But situations make me do that. I would never wear short sleeve again. Too much scars. But i don't regret to cut myself. Because that's the only way to make me live. Maybe people say easy that i should get a divorce or just leave him or ask my family. But that's not easy. I have tried to end my life many times after i moved here. But I'm failed. I hope one day i can be gone. Life is so unfair. I don't want to live this life anymore. I want someone to kill me.."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of extreme dissatisfaction with their marriage, describing their spouse as ruining their life and cheating on them. They also mention feeling unsupported, isolated, and trapped in a different country with a baby and no one by their side. The mention of self-harm, previous suicide attempts, and a desire for someone to kill them indicate a significant level of emotional distress and hopelessness. These symptoms align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""I just ate cereal out of a pot because I was too lazy to wash a single bowl. I honestly have no idea how a day is gonna go anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of apathy and lack of motivation towards even basic tasks like washing a dish. The poster describes feeling uncertain and unaware of how their day will unfold, which suggests a lack of structure and direction in their life. This lack of motivation and disinterest in self-care aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly a symptom called anhedonia, which is a difficulty finding pleasure in activities that were once enjoyable. Overall, the post indicates a level of emotional distress and indifference towards daily life that is consistent with depression."
"Consider this post: """"You can count on me"" That sweet lie. Maybe this post is a way to vent. Maybe I just need to feel like someone, somwhere has read this and, in a way, I've actually said it. I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have, I consider them quite close. One of them (let's cal him Joel) is by far the one whom i have a closest relationship with we are bouth 30 right now. I met him as the boyfriend of a workmate about 7 years ago and even after they broke up we stayed as friends. Joel has a tendency for depression, and I've always tried to help him in any way possible. Because of this problem he ended up hooked on Cocaine, he admited it to me, and we tried everything possible to solve it. So far he seems to be dealing with it reasonably well, but I've had some very rough nights in which i would recieve a text message, wake up at 4 am, grab my keys and drive to his home to literally hold him in my hands while he cried back to sleep and then sand the rest of the night outside his bedroom's door. Basically, When I say the words ""You can count on me for anything"" I really mean it, and I think I've proved that to him. Fast forward to last May and, for the first time in many, many years (before i even met him) I was hit with depression myself for various reasons. It hit me hard, suicide attempt hard. I tried to deal with it by myself, but finally turned to him and told him what was happening during what I consider the worst night so far in my life. The night I hugged my dog, left him at a friends house ""for a few days because i had to leave the city for work"" and drove to the forest with the intention of not comming back. In that forest I called Joel in tears, told him whats was happening to me (didnt tell him what i was planning) and he literally said ""I feel bad i can't go there, but I had promissed someone else I havent seen in a while to hang out tonight"" but told me I ""could count on him for whatever I needed"". To say I was shocked would be an understatement. Obviously I didnt end my life that day, but I could not believe what had happened. I tried to ignore it, called Joel the very next day and asked him to meet me whenever it was possible. This was in May. I would not see Joel's face until September 2nd after basically begging him to meet up. I'm writing this on November 26, and we have met once since then, a day I had to beg for again in which i planned to tell him how I was dealing with my problem. He invited a girlfriend he just met and a co-worker to said meeting. I find myself thinking about this every day, about how a person can be so selfish to have a friend, someone temselves call his best friend, in this situation and proceed to ignore it and basically run away. After all we have been through this situation is hurting me far more than the reasons that nearly drove me to suicide some months ago. I want to tell something to everyone who has taken the time to read this. **Never say ""You can count on me"" if you dont mean it,** you may think you do, but consider if you are actually up to the task. Because,** a failure in this regard can completely crush someone's spirit far more than any problem they needed help with in the first place.**"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and betrayal. The poster shares their experience of offering support and being there for a friend who struggled with depression and drug addiction, only to be let down when they reached out for help themselves. The post describes the poster's own battle with depression, including a suicide attempt, and expresses deep hurt and disappointment in their friend's lack of support. The overall tone is one of despair, hurt, and a feeling of being emotionally crushed. This aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression and indicates a significant level of emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""What is a functional family? I know what a dysfunctional family is and I have plenty of experiences from my formative years to share with y’all but, I am not going to regale you with a “woe is me” diatribe. That’s not my objective today. My objective is to seek positive experiences to better understand the foundational attributes of a functional family. I believe, in fact, I know these families exist based on my South American experiences from an entire society but, what about North America? Families are families no matter the country you live in but, is the lack of family attributes / cohesion as a collective whole uniquely North American for many of us but, not all? In short, let’s dig in to uncover some of these positive family attributes in my next post and I look forward to reading your responses."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster is discussing the concept of a functional family and seeking positive experiences and information from other users. While they briefly mention their own experiences with a dysfunctional family, they explicitly state that they do not want to focus on their own personal struggles. The tone of the post is curious and open-minded, suggesting a desire to learn and understand rather than experiencing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Whats her problem? I told a friend i became vegan and she talked about it behind my back with other friends that i didnt tell yet.She told me after that one of the girls said that i wouldnt last as a vegan and was kind of bringing me down about it.Shes not even vegetarian or vegan and guess what ..this friend immediately started eating vegetarian meals and watching vegan videos and now she says shes vegetarian and wants to go vegan.I'm so annoyedd she talked shit about me not being able to be vegan and all and now thats what she wants to do and became a vegetarian."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post primarily expresses feelings of annoyance and frustration towards a friend who talked about the poster's decision to become vegan behind their back and then proceeded to adopt a similar lifestyle. While the poster may be irritated by the friend's behavior, there is no indication of significant emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post is more focused on annoyance and venting about the friend's actions, rather than a deep sense of hopelessness or despair."
"Consider this post: ""A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive? A long time friend of mine (let’s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but I’m not sure if it’s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now we’re not speaking. Also, we’re 14 and just started high school. 1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just ‘being honest’. 2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn’t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn’t want to ditch her if she hadn’t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn’t bother me (it didn’t, I was upset because she didn’t care about me) and that she wouldn’t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy ‘we’ll sor-ry’. 3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off. I thought this was smart. I figured they’d either realize we weren’t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse. Eventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came. Now, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood. I don’t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, “You realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.” I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I’m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, “Hey, I heard you were followed...” or ANYTHING. Just straight up “it’s your fault I have no sympathy.” Like, Hey, nice to see you too. Either way, we’re not talking anymore. I’ve tried to bring it up but it’s always, “I was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? You’re being silly...” No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, I’m scared to be alone. Sorry for how long this is, I think it’s sort of a rant too. What should I do? Am I completely out of line? How should I go about fixing this? At the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

"Consider this post: ""Awful Friend Trying to Reunite Friend Group I have this friend, let's call him G, and he was a part of a friend group that I brought together. To make a long story short, he got bored, and (admittedly) lied about me to them, then when he found out they didn't like him as much as they liked each other, he ran back to me. I let him be my friend again, and he outed me as bi to my religious summer camp, which I then had to leave. He came back 3 months later saying he was going to therapy and he realized what he did wrong and was trying to get better, so we kept distant contact, but I found out last week he was still friends with the people he lied to (who are now gossiping about me and trying to convince my friends to end their friendships with me). I told him I was done being friends with him because he constantly endangers me or puts me in uncomfortable positions, and he called me crying about how he just wishes things were ""like they were in freshman year"" and that he ""should have never lied to them"". I hung up. He messaged me this morning asking me to meet up with our old friend group over spring break. I don't know what to do. I want my friends back but I'm scared they will hurt me again.""

"Consider this post: ""It's become a personality trait Depression has become part of my identity. As much as I'd like to say it doesn't define me, it really does, it controls my life enough to debilitate my every day experiences. I know we have one life and that there's nothing after that but that fact isn't motivating. In many moments like this I'm convinced that this is all life is and can be and the repetitive, short range, unchanging emotions is my proof. Feels completely pointless and childish to even vent, me writing this feels ridiculous."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

I also suffer from anxiety but i learned more to deal with it now. But times like this it gets a little harder. We lost our dog 4 weeks ago and just a week after that my father lost his brother so its most likely that which is causing the high anxiety and depression(?) It brings the whole family down and i'm a bit worried about my father but i don't know what to do. We have been talking about this and he is aware that he is suffering from anxiety, but we all do to some extent i guess. But he is in a bad place right now. Maybe i just wanted to get stuff out my chest. Any suggestions?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does convey a sense of concern and worry for the father's mental health, mentioning his anxiety, panic attacks, and potential depression.

The main focus of the post seems to be seeking suggestions and support for helping their father, rather than expressing their own profound emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Am I depressed or just self-pitying? I don't really understand what counts as depression but I've had no motivation to really do anything since as long as I can remember. Sometimes I get a burst of motivation and try to do something but I give up really easily. It's really easy to say that I'm depressed as an excuse for the way I feel but I'm still able to function so I don't think I can say I am. I still shower, eat, go to work, even the gym sometimes. I'm not really close with my family, I rarely talk to them and its only when they talk to me and I'm okay with that since I don't really feel like I want to or could hold a conversation with them. Friends I have, I hang out with them sometimes but half the time it feels like a lot of work. I have a girlfriend and I cling to her so hard because I'm so happy when I'm with her and when I'm not with her I'm always thinking of her and get sad that I'm not with her. She recently told me that the way I think of relationships is immature and she cant offer that much time to me since she has other friends who need her too and get mad at her for not soending enough time with them. I can't let go of the way I think relatiomships should be and I want her to reciprocate even if I know it's irrational and I don't feel like anything else in life is really worth living for. I'm not suicidal though, there's a few times it crossed my mind but I always think about how I wouldn't really ever do it or start regretting it while thinking about it because what if things do get better? Other times I feel like going to sleep one night and not waking up would be nice though."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of motivation and difficulty in following through with tasks, which can be indicative of depression. The poster also mentions not feeling close to family and having difficulty maintaining conversations with them, which can be a sign of social withdrawal or isolation often seen in individuals with depression. The reliance on the girlfriend for happiness and the intense sadness when not with her suggests a possible dependence on others for emotional well-being. The mention of irrational thinking regarding relationships and feeling that nothing else in life is worth living for also demonstrate a negative and hopeless outlook, which are commonly associated with depression. While the poster mentions not being suicidal, the thoughts of not waking up and considering the idea of sleep as an escape can still be concerning and indicative of depressive thoughts. Overall, the post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress and negative thinking patterns that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone I decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest. I hate myself and I hate my life. I feel trapped at an absolute dead end in my life, and I'm not even in my twenties yet. I might as well be, considering everything I have to do. I turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one. My mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. My dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth. I honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up. I hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly. The list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I'm so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just... wrong. Like I know something bad is bound to happen. Idk, I'm just confused and scared."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several strong emotional indicators of very severe depression.

I had friends that would try to help me but idk if they just got sick of me not getting any better or if I was a bad friend or what... I’m only 17 but I’ve felt this meaninglessness since I was eight. It’s one of the few things I even remember from back then.

I'm still on my parents insurance plan which should cover most of the cost. However, I've heard it can be a bad idea to use insurance to pay for therapy as insurance companies can audit your sessions to see if you still require them to keep paying for it.

"Consider this post: ""Longtime close friend, brand-new bewilderment My friend is distractable. He thinks irrationally. And he barely listens anymore. I feel as though I've become a pane of glass or a mirror to him. When we're in a car together, he drones on about things (tell me if this has happened to you) he's told me many times before. Occasionally, in the middle, there's an admission: ""I probly told you this before, but.."". However, the story always continues, even if I briefly recap the story for him. When it's obvious the information has been shared, the most pressing imperative seems to be on reiterating it. Perhaps I didn't give the desired response the first time. I get the feeling he just doesn't care whether I'd like to hear it. I also possess conversational preferences, and they never include hearing the same story twice. After countless reccurences of this scenario, it seems that my considerations aren't really valued or remembered. Mentally, he seems to be on a train and passengers (myself included) are always bustling through and, as such, might just seem replaceable. There doesn't seem anymore to be a genuine interest in my take on things. Questions are rarely asked, and if they are, they're poised in such a way as to elicit some agreeable response. We've never had a problem with differing opinions, but lately there is a marked disinterest in mine. If I express perhaps a different perspective I might share on something, he's typically halfway through deconstructing it and preparing a rebuttal by the time I've reached the bulk of my first sentence. Lately, I make sure to be concise. 10-word sentences. Brief, clear declarations with stipulations kept to a minimum. I do this in a sincere effort to make sure at least some of my thoughts reach him via this channel called speech. I feel a little like a sidekick, implicitly expected to go along with whatever is said or suggested and quietly supporting. I have needs and I make sure they're met. I just make sure, now, that they're met completely before I go into a conversation or endeavor with him. The attention span has completely plummeted. He and his phone might as well have fused into one entity. Often times, when we're driving somewhere, or at our shared place of work, he will open a conversation. What he desires to be communicated is seemingly achieved. I give plenty of time, listening quietly and waiting a few seconds before responding. When I respond, sometimes I'll be surprised that I've been able to speak for a couple of sentences without being interrupted. Then, I'll look up and almost invariably, he's on his phone texting, on social media, or looking at boobs. I fall silent and look at him, stopping my speech, and sometimes there's a feigned response that hazily resembles some degree of mental assimilation. Other times, my input is simply ignored. I feel often that I am relegated to silence by virtue of necessity. What is the point of talking or even attempting to share with someone if they feel their device is more important than you? When there is no device involved, the listening is of such low quality that I feel as though I'm viewed as a shadow, or some reflective panel that occasionally flashes some piece of light which sparks a brief reaction. I use the word reaction explicitly to differentiate from response. Responding, to me, would be careful consideration of the texture of the exchange. What I see falls on a spectrum between bristling and hyperenthusiastic. Everything in the observable behavior appears to come from an emotionally fueled place. I long ago ceased trying to appeal to logic and reason, because there seems to be a fantasy aspect to his formulations about reality, business, and essentially learning in general. An obstinate and vigorous type of chauvinism appears when the discussion involves logically based and scientifically supported criterion as pillars of discussion. ""Have you ever thought that maybe our ideas about science are just implanted by society, and another race has fully influenced our evolution as human beings?"" (to imply that the scrutiny intrinsic to the scientific community's assimilation of data is too dismissive toward fringe and pseudoscientific contributions). ""Physics is just one way to understand reality; there are physics we aren't even aware of that we won't know about for hundreds of years"" (as a soft excuse"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects a deep sense of frustration, sadness, and a feeling of being unheard or unimportant. The poster expresses feelings of being disregarded, undervalued, and replaced by their friend, who exhibits behavior that suggests a lack of interest and engagement. The post also highlights the poster's attempts to improve the situation, such as adjusting their own communication style and practicing patience, but acknowledges the difficulties and challenges they face. Overall, the post conveys a significant level of emotional distress and the impact it has on their relationship with their friend, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

Looking back on my childhood, I can definitely see some signs of childhood depression. The past year has been particularly bad in terms of my mental health. I'm better than I was a year ago. I've joined a gym. I do pole dancing. I got a cat. I have a therapist. I'm medicated. I volunteer more. I see occasional good things in myself. I'm not actively suicidal anymore. Yet... I'm still depressed. I've changed my life so fucking much and I'm still fucking depressed. I still have more work to do to ""fix myself"" (fucking diet, fucking exercise, bullshit mindfulness) but it all just feels like so much goddamn work at the end of the day. I don't know what I'm working towards. I can't comprehend a world in which I don't wake up in an apartment that needs to be cleaned because I'm too tired and too lazy to do it or that I don't spend my time in a numb, self-loathing void. I don't know how people get through their days liking themselves or liking their life. It's frustrating and lonely. There are some days where I wish I was suicidal because the rest of my life wouldn't feel so long and full of drudgery. I can't see me getting well. I just can't.""

The poster expresses a long history of depression and describes making efforts to improve their mental health, such as joining a gym, doing pole dancing, getting a cat, having a therapist, being medicated, and volunteering.

"Consider this post: ""Any recommended supplements/vitamins for depression? (Or maybe just tips in general) Lately, I have been taking Vitamin D and doing some light exercising throughout the week and I have noticed the improvement on my mood. It might just be a placebo type of thing, but it would be great if any of you guys can recommend more alternatives/habits to do when depressed.

"Consider this post: ""A rant, I guess I had to come off of my antidepressants for medical testing. I'm finally off of them and I can't take this. I didn't think they were working and I definitely wasn't where I wanted to be when I was at my maximum dose, but oh my God. I started them for anxiety mostly so I'm surprised that I'm relapsing so hard into depression. I just wish I didn't exist-- eh, better yet I wish I didn't have to participate in every day life. I don't know what to do. I used to have so much motivation to finish my college work and now I have none. I have finals that start tomorrow that I haven't studied for at all. Like, not even a little. And somehow I don't care. That's just not like me. I'm exhausted from putting so much effort in all the time. I exhausted from being stressed all the time. I don't want to keep doing this. I just want to sleep. And to think I have four more years ahead of me. I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel like a failure. I keep thinking that maybe I could find something to take my mind off things but I have no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything any more. Not even eating, which I used to love probably too much but hey. I want to lie in my floor and watch the days pass by me. I don't want to have to keep trying. Another thing is everything and everyone irritates the living hell out of me now. The smallest thing sends me over the edge into my spiral. Three weeks ago if I spilled my coffee I would have laughed it off. It happened the other day and I cried for hours and was so angry. Three weeks ago I was better than this. And I'm crashing all of a sudden. I don't know how I'm going to study for my finals and maintain my GPA to keep my scholarships. I'm fucked probably. My therapist is not that great and I haven't seen her in awhile and I don't have money to go back to her. My psych appointment isn't until late January, after my medical procedure. I just want to be happy and have some motivation for fucks sake."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

"Consider this post: ""Sometimes I don't feel like a real person I feel like I'm just floating through my life, but my body isn't actually there. I'm trying to make sense of everything but its just really difficult. Tried to make sense of how I feel but its just a big mess in my brain. I've no motivation. I try, but I just can't. I feel stupid and useless. I just don't know what to do. There's so much more I want to say but I just don't know how to form the words to describe it.

"Consider this post: ""I want to share a personal project I'm proud of A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I'm not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything. Then I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book ""Feeling Good"" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed... some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the ""three-column technique."" But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful. One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the ""Depression Checklist,"" which (as I'm sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the ""Moderate"" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the ""Mild"" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression. What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood. Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I've gotten further along in the work, I've noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the ""Normal"" range of depressive emotions! I couldn't believe it. Regardless, the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood isn't at the level it was a couple weeks ago, it's nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction :) (Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](https://beok.herokuapp.com/). It's stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I'm still kinda proud of it... and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a range of emotions and experiences commonly associated with depression, such as feeling unmotivated, lacking deep connections, low self-worth, and contemplating quitting everything. The poster describes a period of improvement after seeking support and reading a book on depression, demonstrating an active effort to address their emotional state. The mention of creating a personal project as a coping mechanism and mood booster suggests a desire for purpose and a sense of accomplishment, which are sometimes used as strategies to manage depression.

"Consider this post: ""Alone It’s been so long since someone’s actually made me feel okay. It’s been so long since someone has genuinely made me laugh.

"Consider this post: ""I walked out of a job yesterday. I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all. I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems. I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample: - I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) - There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day. I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious. The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together. - I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so."" - I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. - Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events. I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities. Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband. After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump. I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know. I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human. I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure. I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off. I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine. I'm trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits a high level of emotional distress and hopelessness. The poster describes walking out of a job they believed to be their dream job, only to discover it was not. They outline specific reasons for quitting, including not liking the hours, religious tensions, false promises, and excessive expectations.

"Consider this post: ""I am scared Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase. Anyway, a bit of back story: Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc. Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie. So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible. Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do? I've added an image for reference: https://imgur.com/8fZq5JO Edit: I never blocked him, I deleted my account because fuck Facebook.""

Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a complex mix of emotions, including guilt, happiness, and a sense of feeling exposed. The poster expresses feeling conflicted about people checking up on them, initially feeling happy but then questioning the authenticity of the concern. This inner turmoil and self-doubt are common symptoms of depression.

Secondly this was because of that but I because shy and anxious all the time thinking about what people thought of me. So didn't make many friends in school. Then during school my attention gravitated towards video games and my grades became shit. Therefore felt like university wasn't an option for me. I was taking to this girl I liked and she didn't seem to bothered about my appearance more my personality but she was interested in someone else.

Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

"Consider this post: ""I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago Hello everyone, I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing. So basically, I'm 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I don't see it happening) I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before) I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise. My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment. And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside. Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period. Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression.

"Consider this post: ""Can people stop telling me that hiking and exercise is the magical cure? It just frustrates me so much, and continues the perpetual cycle of ""well if I can't make myself better through such simple actions I must be even more of a failure than I realised"". I appreciate the science behind it, releasing endorphins yada yada, but if I can't bring myself to drink water or get out of bed how am I supposed to go for a jog? If I'm so insecure about myself why would running and jiggling in front of everyone to imagine their sneery comments going to make me feel better? Where do I find the energy to go for a hike when being awake for three hours makes my body physically ache? I get it, it's helpful for a lot of people but telling me to go get my yoga pants on and be at one with nature will not cure a thing and by repeating that useless mantra you're making me worse. Rant over, I'm going back to bed. Edit: a few people telling me if I exercise I will lose weight and feel better about myself. I only need to try it apparently. On the advice of my doctor, I have tried it, even walking. I do walk, every day, no matter how I feel. I also don't need to lose weight and being overweight is not the reason I am depressed (because I'm not overweight). Just saying to stop preaching the exercise mantra as if it's the only thing that could possibly fix what is a very real mental illness that has nothing to do with how often I move, flex or jump. My point is that it's not working."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

These emotions align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, indicating a significant level of emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""What kind of things do you want people to tell you? Whenever I reach out to someone about my depression, it seems like they never tell me the things that I want to hear. I usually want someone to protect me, to hug me and tell me they’ll help me every step of the way. I’ve never gotten that though. What do you guys want to hear? I’m wondering if it’s different for everyone and maybe that’s why we never seem to get the right reaction"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is struggling with depression. They express a desire for support and understanding from others, specifically wanting someone to provide physical comfort and assurance that they will receive help throughout their journey. The mention of not receiving this desired response in the past suggests a lack of appropriate emotional support, which can be distressing for someone with depression. This post reflects feelings of vulnerability, loneliness, and a sense of not being understood, all of which are commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Brother rage attack my grandmother My brother is prone to rage attacks. Him and I had that classic ""brother love"" growing up. Anyways this isn't about me it's about my grandmother. So my grandma from my mom's side came from out of the country to live with us for a couple months (my brother and I still live with our mom). To help with housework and see our family. She is the one of the sweetest ladies out there. Typical caring loving person, very sensitive and full of love &amp; happiness. Now my brother comes into the equation... he's had his rage bursts with me and I've learned to deal with it as well as my mother. They say how you treat your mom is how you treat your wife. Honestly, he's so disrespectful to my mom at times it makes me vehement. What can I do come in and save the day (when I have done in the past it only made things worse). Anyways, I thought I knew my brother well and knew he wouldn't dare yell at my grandma. OMG boy was I wrong he crossed that line. A rage attack came at my grandma with yelling and this time I did intervene. After things settled I consoled my grandma she was shocked, sad, unable to believe he was like this. So I told her the truth he has always been like this and I feel just as much pain as she felt becuase seeing her distraught was one of the most depressing things I have ever witnessed. She wants to leave and go back although I can tell she is worried for me &amp; my mom. Hate to break the news baba but ya he's a fucking entitled narcisstic pieces of shit on the planet. I understand when guys blow steam with other guys but seriously to your own mother and grandmother. I think it's completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Note: our dad is not involved because he doesnt live with us or see us often I left a lot of details however, you understand the picture. Question: He will not change, I think as a family we should distance ourselves from him carefully. Yes or No?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes their brother's rage attacks and the negative impact it has on their family, specifically their grandmother. The poster expresses feeling pain, shock, and depression as a result of witnessing their grandmother's distress. The use of profanity and strong negative language to describe the brother suggests a deep level of emotional distress and anger. The poster also contemplates the idea of distancing themselves from the brother, which could be indicative of a lack of hope in resolving the situation and a desire to protect themselves and their loved ones from further harm. Overall, the post conveys a significant level of emotional distress and despair that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""The answer is never in the bottom of a glass of bourbon... and yet here I am again, looking for it. I'm not sure how long I can keep doing this for. Not the drink, the whole thing. I wish I could cry really hard. I feel like that would help but it never comes."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of hopelessness and reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism. The poster acknowledges that the answer to their problems is not found in alcohol, yet they continue to turn to it. They express uncertainty about how long they can continue living like this, indicating a significant emotional struggle. The mention of wanting to cry and feeling like it would help, but being unable to, suggests a suppressed emotional state and a potential inability to express or process emotions fully. This combination of factors aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Tired of being lonely but there’s not much I can do about it. I just want to feel like there’s someone to talk to out there but, no one in my life ever wants to talk with me about anything except to yell at me or to tell me to do something. That is the extent of my daily social life. I could probably go a month without saying anything or talking to anyone and no one would even care or notice, I need social interaction like anyone else, but what do I do if I can’t get it? I can interact at work ok, but that’s not really the same. Online interaction isn’t really the same either."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness and a lack of meaningful social interaction. The poster expresses a longing for someone to talk to and a feeling of being ignored or dismissed by the people in their life. They mention that their daily social life consists solely of negative interactions, such as being yelled at or instructed to do something. The poster also states that they could go a month without speaking to anyone and nobody would notice or care. This highlights a profound sense of isolation and the lack of connection with others. The mention of online interaction not being the same suggests that the poster may have tried to seek social engagement through alternative means but found it to be unsatisfying. The overall tone of longing, frustration, and hopelessness aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I’ve eaten meals by myself for so long Never really had people who stayed with me... Recess usually spent alone... Now, I find it hard, weird, awkward and very uncomfortable to eat with people. I just wanna isolate myself from the world."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects a deep sense of loneliness and isolation. The poster mentions eating alone for a long time and not having people who stayed with them, which suggests a pattern of social detachment.

"Consider this post: ""Shoudl I just stop being friends with this guy? I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it’s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying “you got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.” This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called “best friend.” He randomly went up to a girl I didn’t know and told her I liked her, she then said “I don’t care.” I don’t know if this was a rejection or just a simple “I don’t care” but I didn’t really care because I didn’t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word “nigga.” Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i’m half black and she says “I know.” This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it’s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn’t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl’s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn’t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, “you’re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That’s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.” And he walked away, as i’m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn’t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It’s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i’d have much better friends. What do I do, it’s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this “friend” if mine?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post presents a clear emotional distress due to the interactions with the supposed ""best friend."" The poster describes feelings of attachment and difficulty letting go, similar to their previous relationship. They express hurt and frustration towards their friend's insensitive and hurtful behavior, which includes making fun of them and spreading rumors. The mention of being made fun of based on their race and ethnicity also indicates a level of emotional distress and potential impact on their self-esteem. Overall, the post reveals significant emotional turmoil and negative experiences in relationships, suggesting a potential presence of depression."
"Consider this post: ""Do you ever feel like you can't do anything right and everyone secretly hates you? I've felt like that for as long as I can remember, and it feels like no matter how many times people tell me it's not true, I can't convince myself that I'm not a worthless waste of human existence and that everyone doesn't see me for the shitty person that I am. How can anyone else like me if I don't even like myself? I'll always be alone with only my parents caring about me because they feel obligated to and they probably don't think I could function without them. Even with them, I can barely function."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a strong sense of low self-worth, self-doubt, and self-criticism. The poster believes that they cannot do anything right and that everyone secretly hates them. They describe feeling like a worthless waste of human existence and express difficulty in believing any positive feedback they receive from others. The mention of feeling alone and only having their parents care about them out of obligation suggests a lack of social support and feelings of isolation.

"Consider this post: ""After struggling more than a year I finally cut off all contact with my crush I deleted her from every friendlist, unfollowed her everywhere and basically removed her from my life after years of friendship. I just couldn't deal with it anymore. Loving her is one of the reasons I am as miserable as I am right now and as stupid as it sounds, one of the reasons I think about suicide daily just because I can't get her out of my head. I hope it helps and I hope she'll never get in touch with me and asks what's going on. I just want to forget her."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys intense emotional pain and despair. The poster describes cutting off all contact with their crush and removing them from their life, stating that loving them is a reason for their current misery and thoughts of suicide. The mention of wanting to forget the person and hoping they never get in touch implies a deep desire to escape from the emotional distress caused by the relationship. The combination of intense emotional pain, thoughts of suicide, and a sense of hopelessness indicates a significant level of emotional distress consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Today’s my birthday, and no one remembered. I wish I could skip today so I wouldn’t have to feel so terrible. No one ever notices me. I could never hold a candle to anyone else. I’m just going to go to sleep. Edit: I didn’t expect so many people to care about me and it honestly made me feel a lot better about myself today. Thank you so much for all the wishes."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of sadness, loneliness, and feelings of worthlessness. The poster expresses disappointment and despair over no one remembering their birthday and feeling unnoticed and insignificant compared to others.

However, the edit at the end indicates that the poster received unexpected support and well wishes, which made them feel better about themselves. While the label of depression may not be as severe as the previous example, the initial post exhibits significant emotional distress and negative self-perception, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""i should stop complaining i should stop complaining and shut the fuck up. or maybe the thoughts should shut the fuck up. i don’t deserve any of the happiness i have left. i don’t deserve any of the kindness i’ve gotten in the past. i’m a piece of shit. i want to desperately stop existing but i don’t want to leave my boyfriend behind. i think i’m lying to myself half of the time anyway. one moment i’m self loathing, the other i’m not. does that mean i’m just unstable? unstable and stupid? am i over-exaggerating? because i don’t think it’s a big deal that i cut myself and i want to die.""

The poster expresses intense self-loathing and feelings of unworthiness, stating that they don't deserve any happiness or kindness they have received.

"Consider this post: ""The toughest pill to swallow is that I care about the girl most I've lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years. My parents trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now. I've lost all my Bitcoin in a fire. I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I'll admit this one was getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could've prevented it. But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal ass girl. But I love her. I love being around her. And she probably doesn't even give a shit about me because she has a boyfriend. We hung out at a park and had a great time, we always do when we talk... But she's never the one to start a conversation and never offers to hang out. Okay, boyfriend, but at least let me be your friend. Just planning a meetup is such a pain the ass. I wish you'd just tell me to fuck off, but you keep saying yes. All while you straight up don't give a shit about me. Hope is the worst part. I'm still clinging to my failing studies, new random ass coins and this *fucking* girl. I can't even concentrate on the other two because I think of her all the time. I'm desperately trying to stay relevant to her in hopes I can catch her when she is available again and I feel like such a fucking creepy loser. All for that small chance."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays clear indicators of emotional distress, hopelessness, and self-esteem issues. The poster describes a loss of motivation, lack of ambition, and feeling like they have been ""floating around doing nothing"" for years. They express feelings of disgust from their parents and a significant financial loss that has affected them greatly. However, the main focus of their depression appears to be a girl who they are deeply in love with but who does not reciprocate their feelings. They express a preoccupation with thoughts of her, desperation to stay relevant to her, and feeling like a ""creepy loser"" in their attempts to catch her attention. The intense emotional attachment and the negative impact it has on their overall well-being align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years. https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014. I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative. While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself. All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode. I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it. I used [this](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) word cloud generator. Cheers."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post includes a deep level of self-reflection and awareness regarding the poster's history of depressive posts. They express a realization that their negative thoughts and self-perception during depressive episodes may not accurately reflect their true self. This introspection suggests a heightened level of emotional distress and dissatisfaction with their mental state. Additionally, the mention of ""something's wrong"" and the desire for an easy way to manage it indicates a struggle with their emotional well-being. The overall tone of the post portrays a sense of hopelessness and resignation towards the possibility of change, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

Reasoning: The post exhibits a level of distress or upset, as the poster mentions being unable to think about the situation without getting upset. However, the emotions expressed are not as intense or overwhelming as those typically associated with very severe depression. The post primarily focuses on seeking advice and sharing screenshots of a conflict on Facebook, rather than expressing deep feelings of hopelessness, despair, or emotional pain. Therefore, it is unlikely that the poster suffers from depression based on this post alone."
"Consider this post: ""GF stopped taking antidepressants So my LDR girlfriend just recently stopped taking antidepressants because her mother pressured her into it. She clearly needs them, she can barely function without them and I told her but she refuses to take them again. Her mother, by the way, is bipolar and very mentally abusive. It seems like my GF had been convinced by her mother that not taking meds is the way to go. I told my parents about this and they agree with her not taking them, claiming it’ll help the “chemicals leave her body.” I don’t know what to do. I want to support her decision but her getting off her meds is clearly affecting her negatively and she’s even sadder and less motivated to do anything now. It’s currently impossible for us to live together and we visit each other 1-2 times a year when school is out. We’re both in uni. I myself stopped taking antidepressants cold turkey as well (that was about 5 years ago) and I’m still depressed but not to the point where I can’t go out and do what I’m supposed to like she is experiencing right now. I love her and want to be with her forever but I don’t know how to help at this point, she’s not receptive to my help and hates herself and has no friends where she lives, a small town in Canada."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes their girlfriend's struggle with functioning without antidepressants and expresses concern about her decision to stop taking them. They mention that her mother is mentally abusive, which implies a challenging and potentially toxic living situation. The poster also highlights their own experience with depression and mentions that their girlfriend is experiencing increased sadness and lack of motivation. The mention of feeling helpless and unsure of how to support their girlfriend further suggests emotional distress. Overall, the post conveys a sense of hopelessness, concern for their girlfriend's well-being, and a lack of control over the situation, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Music has a huge effect on my moods Music has a huge effect on my moods. I have been having an okay day with a good amount of anxiety and my depression hasn't been so strong. The depression is not of course gone. It's just not as bad today. I was listening to this song that I like which is ironic but it's a pretty sad song. It triggered me and made me really sad and made my depression worse. I was thinking of my abuse, my relationship with my girlfriend and other things during it. I was thinking of a lot of things and then my mood flipped. Is anyone okay messaging me to talk? I can support you too if you want."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster experiences mood changes influenced by music, suggesting a potential lack of emotional stability. They mention having an okay day with anxiety and a less severe depression, indicating that they still experience depression on a regular basis. The triggering effect of a sad song further exacerbates their depression and prompts intrusive thoughts about past abuse and their relationship, which implies unresolved emotional pain. The willingness to reach out and offer support to others may also indicate a deep empathy that is often associated with individuals who have experienced depression. Overall, the post shows a significant connection between music, emotional triggers, depressive symptoms, and a need for support, suggesting a potential presence of depression."
"Consider this post: ""I feel like I'm a terrible person for being sad My life is going fine: I have solid grades, I hardly have to study, and I'm financially stable. However, even though everything is going great I'm still sad every day, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to kill myself. No one notices that I'm sad, and everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going, and it just makes me feel worse that I can't be happy even when I have everything: every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless. I don't even know who to talk to about this because I don't want to bother anyone, people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems, especially small ones like my feelings."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of sadness and hopelessness, with the poster feeling like a terrible person for experiencing these emotions despite having a seemingly successful life. The mention of contemplating suicide and feeling that every victory is hollow suggests a profound level of emotional distress and despair. Additionally, the fear of burdening others with their problems and the belief that their feelings are insignificant indicate low self-esteem and a lack of support. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""I spend to many days trying not to cry Being around people does not help me one bit and it's not their fault. Every time I leave the house I get so sad over everything.

Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a frequent struggle to hold back tears and describes how being around people does not provide any relief from emotional distress. The poster also mentions feeling overwhelmed with sadness whenever they leave the house.

The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of sadness, loneliness, and a lack of emotional stability, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Help, I'm not sure if my partner is depressed. I need help moving forward. A little background on my partner and our relationship, he's 23 and I'm 21. He lost his mother to sickness when he was 17 years old, dropped out of school because of that and moved away to complete a foundation course. We met while he was back home but he currently studies overseas to complete his bachelor's degree. However, he's been home for the past 2.5 weeks as he is having his semester break. We began dating a year and 2 months ago. He's been nothing but the most supportive and kind partner I've ever had the honour of dating. Very caring, remembers the little things and is very physically affectionate. However for the past 2.5 weeks, he's been incredibly hot and cold with me. The worst instance having been on Thursday (4 days ago). We had planned to meet at 2pm, but at 2pm he asks if we can meet at 5pm because 'the weather is too hot'. Fair enough, so we decide to meet at 5pm. When I meet him, he is cold and withdrawn and does not even acknowledge me. I reach for his hand and he lets me hold it, but the bus ride is filled with nothing but silence. He's looking out the window and he doesn't want to speak to me. We reach our destination and head to a restaurant for early dinner, but he orders one tiny dish and doesn't want to eat anymore because he has no appetite. I asked him what's wrong and he said he's just tired. I asked if he's angry at me and he says no. He continues being very physically affectionate by holding my hand and holding my waist but he doesn't want to make eye contact with me or kiss me. He smiles all of 2 times while we're out. We then decide to head to a bar (his decision, even though I told him I'm okay with going home), but we just drank our beers in silence, I tried telling him about a book I had just bought but I could tell he was disinterested. While on the way back home, I teared up while telling him that I've been trying so hard to communicate with him but I have just not gotten a response. He tells me that he's tired and it's got nothing to do with me. We head back home and I tell him to text me when he's back home but he doesn't. It's been 4 days since then and I texted him last night but to no response (it's been 24 hours). Other reasons why I think he may be depressed are:- A week before he came home, he found out his dog of 13 years passed away. \- He has a very erratic sleep schedule. He'll sleep at 5am, wake up at noon. \- He doesn't want to do things that we planned to do. We wanted to go for an exhibition and he said we'll go 'next week' but that hasn't happened yet. \- We haven't had sex in a week. \- He hasn't met his best friend of a few years even though he's been home for 2.5 weeks. \- He hasn't made contact with me for 4 days, this is out of the ordinary. \- He's totally checked out of social media, not stayed up to date with memes and Instagram stories (with the only exception being last night when he watched my Instagram story) \- His Instagram and Twitter bio is ""Have fun. Be kind. Die."" (!!!!) I feel so lost and helpless, and I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to figure out what's going on. I don't know if this could be depression or if it's just a case of him checking out of this relationship. If any of these signs are an indicator, please please please let me know what I can do. I feel especially on edge because he's leaving to go back to uni in a few days but I don't know when I'll be able to see him again. I don't know how to reach out to him, he didn't respond to my text message and the last thing I want to do is shove him deeper into isolation. Please give me any advice you can on how to go about dealing with the situation. I love him so much and I want to support him, but I don't know how"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster describes their partner's sudden change in behavior, including being hot and cold, withdrawn, silent, disinterested, and lacking appetite. These behaviors, along with a lack of response to communication attempts, are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as emotional numbness, withdrawal from activities, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, changes in appetite, and disrupted sleep patterns. The mention of the partner's dog passing away and their overall disengagement from social media further suggests a loss of pleasure and interest in life. The mention of their partner's Instagram and Twitter bio, which includes the phrase ""Have fun. Be kind. Die."" raises significant concern about their mental state. The poster expresses feeling lost, helpless, and on edge, indicating their own emotional distress in response to their partner's behavior. Overall, the post strongly suggests that the partner may be experiencing depression and the poster is in need of advice on how to support them."
"Consider this post: ""Did I do the right thing? Hello,reddit.First of all,I want to begin this by saying that English isn't my first language,so please do forgive me if I make mistakes here and there. Let's get straight to the point: I'm in highschool,10th grade.I've known my ''best friend'' since 1st grade.Y'know,it was that kind of nice,pleasant friendship,I was always there for her,she was always there for me,even travelling togheter,laughing with tears,told me many times that I'm her only ''true friend'' etc etc... and everything seemed to be alright...until she got a boyfriend. She started to ignore,even get mad me me as to why I don't text it first..well,why does it matter so much who texts first? Seems like a childish thinking in my opinion.I told her that I can't be the only person that talks in this friendship,so she told me she'll text me first.She never did,but I saw it coming anyway. I realized that for her, it did not matter whether I am next to her or not.She is so apathetic,almost to the point where it hurted me.But I decided to let go,focus more on myself,study more,read more,invest in my own hobbies and so on,so forth.As I was doing these,I started learning more things about myself,discovering things I didn't know about until now.And all of these happened,because I decided to leave her.She noticed this behaviour of mine and actually started talking to me,but it wouldn't matter anyway because it was an endless cycle.All she sees now is her boyfriend,I think the only reason she goes to school is just to see him,nothing else. As I look back at our past [which is,kind of,sorta tragic and I don't want to into detail],I realized that I was the only one who truly cared.I always cried for her,I wonder if she cried for me,at least once?She blocked on me on our social medias for the stupidest reasons [She thought I was annoyed because she was talking too much about her boyfriend] and somehow I was but I didn't want to show it..but what did she accomplish by blocking me for almost a month,anyway? Couldn't she talk to me about it,at least? I told her in the most sincere way that I missed her very much through that period of time and even started worrying,crying in the middle of the night.Her response was short and dry,as usual. I got fed up,starting to blame myself because I always accepted all of her bullshit.I broke our friendship,leaving her confused and perhaps angry at me. [I just started ignoring her and she noticed this]. Did I do the right thing? We haven't talked for almost 3-4 weeks."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a range of strong emotions including hurt, betrayal, apathy, and feelings of being unimportant or unloved. The poster describes a significant change in their friendship dynamic after their best friend got a boyfriend, leading to feelings of being ignored and unimportant. They express their efforts to communicate their feelings and concerns to their friend, but it seems to have been met with apathy and dismissiveness. The poster also reflects on their past experiences and their role as the one who constantly cared and cried for their friend, questioning if their friend ever reciprocated these feelings. The mention of crying, worrying, and feeling confused and angry indicates a high level of emotional distress and turmoil. The overall tone of the post suggests deep emotional pain, disappointment, and a sense of loss, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances? A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good). I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well. Not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing depression despite having good life circumstances. They mention that they are happy with their life overall, but still experience a deep sense of depression that feels as bad as physical pain. They mention trying various medications and exercising regularly, but these methods haven't been effective in alleviating their depression. The post reflects a sense of hopelessness and resignation, as well as a desire to connect with others who may be experiencing a similar situation. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Advice for making it through school In my second year of college my mental health went down drastically and I lost all of my motivation and basically most of my ability to function. I couldn’t do any schoolwork without panicking and crying because I didn’t think I could do it. I was scared of everything. During finals, my cat died and I just sorta gave up. I failed everything and took a year off. My family was so disappointed and treated me so differently for the year that I was out. About a month and a half before the fall semester of 2017, I got on a new medication and decided to felt good enough to go back to school. I knew I had no other option anyway. I did surprisingly well that semester but now that break is over, I’m finding myself just as terrified as I was that semester I failed. I don’t know what happened and I don’t know how to get back to functioning again. I can’t drop out again. Why do I feel so low after having such a strong start? I really thought things were getting better but I feel like I’m being taken over by this again. If anyone else has any advice for getting through it and regaining faith in myself I’d love to hear it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional distress, loss of motivation, and difficulty functioning that is commonly associated with depression. The poster describes feeling panicked, crying, and being scared of everything when trying to do schoolwork, indicating a high level of emotional distress. The mention of failing everything and taking a year off from college, as well as the disappointment and different treatment from family members, suggests the severity of the poster's struggles with their mental health. Despite having a period of improvement and doing well in a recent semester, the poster now feels terrified and low again, indicating a relapse or worsening of their depression symptoms. The plea for advice and the mention of regaining faith in oneself further demonstrate the emotional struggles and lack of hope commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""friend help I’m in community college and I have some friends but they’re all very busy now with either relationships or other friends. I feel very lonely what do I do to make new friends?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not provide strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. It primarily expresses feelings of loneliness and seeking advice on how to make new friends. While loneliness can be a symptom of depression, in this case, the post does not indicate a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or lack of fulfillment. The tone of the post seems more focused on finding solutions and seeking support rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""today is my birthday :) Today is my birthday. 8th alone. 22 today, a number that i never would've thought i would reach. I bought some of my favorite snacks and got my old blanket, just going to watch some of my favorite movies today. I also bought a card for myself ( which i do every year) , written on it was ""Happy Birthday, Love mum and dad""... they were the last people to ever tell that to me and i know that even tho its been over a decade since they're gone, they were the last people to celebrate and be happy because of me, the last people to love me. i miss them so much. I get so lonely, its hard to cope sometimes, i wish i could spend more time with them. I love you mum and dad :) EDIT 1: Thank you all so much for the wishes, it really means a lot. this is the most i've gotten in years. Really made my day, been struggling to cope especially in the last few months, everything is just hitting like a train so thank you to all! Wish you all a good day :) EDIT 2: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE! You are all such awesome people.

It brings tears to my eyes to receive so many thoughtful messages and support, all of you are just great! Hearts of gold. Thank you. Thank you. And to everyone in this subreddit I've finally found my bit of happiness, all thanks to you! I no longer feel alone, and you shouldn't either! Theres so many good people here on reddit. Hope you all are coping and hope you have a great day!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness, longing, and grief. The poster expresses a strong connection to their parents who are no longer alive and describes feeling lonely and struggling to cope, especially in the last few months. Despite it being their birthday, they emphasize the absence of their parents and the longing to spend more time with them. The mention of feeling alone and struggling to cope indicates emotional distress and potential symptoms of depression. However, it is worth noting that the post also includes edits expressing gratitude and appreciation for the support received, suggesting some positive emotions and a sense of temporary happiness. Overall, the post leans towards indicating the presence of depression due to the profound feelings of loneliness and grief."
"Consider this post: ""Advice to restore lost friendship? My cousin and I used to be best friends when we were little. We told each other everything and were inseparable. Then, a bunch of terrible stuff happened to her around middle school and in high school. She shut herself away. Even though we used to tell each other everything, she didn't talk to me as much after that. I love her, and I wanted her to know she could trust me, like she always could. But she didn't talk to me. Or anyone else. Then she moved a whole state away for a couple years. We drifted apart. Far apart. I used to consider her my very best friend, but at that point I didn't feel that way anymore. She now lives close to me again, and we have started hanging out again. I feel like we are starting to get our friendship back, but I still feel like there is something preventing us from getting back to how we used to be when we were little. She has depression and anxiety as a result of everything she has been through. I want her to know I am there for her and that she can trust me completely. I do know her well enough that I can tell when she is having a hard time with something, and today, I could tell she was struggling. I asked how she was doing, and she was upset because she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately. I asked her more about it, but she didn't want to talk about it. That's completely fine; I understand. And I told her as much and also let her know I am always here for her if she needs anything. Now, I say all of that to ask this: how can I let her know that she can open up to me without sounding too pushy? I want to regain what we once had. How can I restore that closeness we used to have?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does mention the poster's cousin having depression and anxiety, but it primarily focuses on the poster's desire to restore their lost friendship. While there is a mention of the cousin struggling with her relationship, the overall tone of the post is not indicative of severe depression. The poster expresses understanding and support for their cousin's boundaries and desires to be there for her. The tone is more focused on seeking advice and strategies for rebuilding the friendship rather than expressing severe emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""My younger brother is cooler than me Hi! So I have a bit of an embarassing truth to admit. I believe my younger brother is way cooler than me. I've never been one of the most popular people in any given situation, but I have a few close friends so it's not too bad. My brother however is one of those people that can walk into a room and immediately own it. Where my clothing style is a bit uninteresting, his is eye-catching. While I'm fairly quiet and not particularily funny, he is confident and charismatic. I get invited to parties every now and then, but he gets invited to parties every week. Oh and it doesn't help that he is taller than me nowadays. He is not better than me at everything thankfully. For instance I'm an organised person and my grades are far above average, while his grades are far below. The point is that I'm not a cool person by any stretch but he is very popular and respected. It's silly I know, but it does hurt my pride a bit seeing as I'm older than him, and you usually expect the older sibling to have the high ground in this respect. Am I alone in this? Anyone else who have experienced something similar? :P"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of insecurity, comparing oneself to a younger sibling who is perceived as being ""cooler"" and more popular. The poster acknowledges their own lack of confidence, charisma, and popularity in comparison to their brother. They also mention feeling hurt and that their pride is affected by this comparison. While there may be some underlying self-esteem issues, the emotions expressed in the post do not seem to reach the level of very severe depression. The focus is primarily on the specific situation and seeking validation or shared experiences from others, rather than conveying a pervasive sense of hopelessness or emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I haven't felt anything in over a month. I have struggled with depression for a few years now, and I was doing really well. I met a girl online that seemed absolutely perfect, and she made me feel truly happy for the first time since I was little. In October, she just stopped replying to me. She sent a message a few weeks later faking to be a family member and lied about committing suicide. I just feel nothing anymore after that."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a lack of emotions and a sense of numbness that has lasted for over a month. The poster mentions struggling with depression in the past and finding happiness through a new relationship. However, the relationship abruptly ended with the girl pretending to commit suicide. This traumatic event has had a profound impact on the poster's emotional state, resulting in a complete loss of feeling. The combination of preexisting depression, the sudden loss of a significant source of happiness, and the traumatic experience of being deceived and lied to contribute to the likelihood of the poster suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""Feeling Broken I was molested when I was 5. I'm 27 now and I've never actually tried to deal with it. I just ignored it, but that doesn't seem to be working anymore. I feel terrified all the time. I feel dirty and used. I've started cutting just to get some relief from the pain. I don't know why I'm posting. I guess I just want to hear somebody say something nice."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys deep emotional pain, trauma, and distress. The poster shares a history of being molested at a young age and confesses to not having dealt with it effectively until now. They express feeling terrified, dirty, and used, and resorting to self-harm as a way to cope with the pain. The mention of wanting to hear something nice suggests a desperate need for support and validation. These intense and distressing emotions, coupled with self-destructive behaviors, point to a high likelihood of the poster suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""This is beyond messed up for me to think but I kind of just need to vent. I got a phone call this morning that my great uncle died last night. I cannot stand this man to begin with. He’s an addict, a liar, a thief, abuser, manipulator, convicted felon multiple times. He was attempting to run from the cops and he hit a telephone pole and he died. Im assuming he was DUI or picking up drugs. I’m not one bit surprised. In fact, I’m surprised he lived this long. He was given every resource and opportunity in the world and he fucked every single one of them up for the past 50+ years. He was one of those people who were better off just in jail so they can’t do harm to themselves, others, and the community. I cringed every time I saw him around. I couldn’t understand for the life of me why people put up with his shit and enable him. The same people who put up with him were the same ones who would complain and complain about him. My mom didn’t want my younger siblings around him.. we wouldn’t put it past him to do stuff to kids. I was so sick of hearing what Kenny did or tried to do. I feel absolutely horrible for my great grandfather who is 85 and is ALWAYS the one to clean up his mess. I feel bad for my great grandfather in the sense he has to burry his son and once again, clean up the mess that he has left. I may be the only person to not see this as a “loss”. No one has to sit around and worry, watch their things, wait around for a phone call that he’s either dead or in jail again. All of the bullshit just stops."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a variety of emotions that are commonly associated with depression, such as anger, frustration, and a sense of hopelessness. The poster describes their negative feelings towards their great uncle, highlighting his negative traits and criminal behavior. These emotions are further exacerbated by the news of their great uncle's death. The mention of the poster's concern for their younger siblings' safety and their great grandfather's burden of cleaning up their great uncle's mess adds to the overall tone of distress and emotional strain. The post conveys a lack of empathy or connection to their great uncle's death, which can be a symptom of depression. Overall, the negative emotions, lack of empathy, and feeling overwhelmed by the situation align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

Just when I think I feel """"""""""ok"""""""" with myself I look go look into the mirror and see a monster staring back at me. Don't even get me started on cell photos. No matter what angles I take or if I'm wearing make up I look horrible. I analyze all my facial features and compare them to conventionally attractive women, I know everything that's wrong with my face and why I'll never be called beautiful or sexy or even cute. I guess this must explain why I'm gawked at so much in public. Imagining what I must look like from someone elses point of view makes me feel ill. I'll never be effortlessly beautiful. I lost the genetic lottery. I'm reminded of this whenever I see photos or gifs of young female models. My DNA is wrong. I don't know what I did to deserve this. I don't even have enough money to get cosmetic surgery. I hate this."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a significant distress and preoccupation with the poster's appearance. They describe a long-standing struggle with their self-image, feeling like a monster when they look in the mirror, and being self-critical of their facial features. The comparison to conventionally attractive women, the belief that they will never be considered beautiful, and the feeling of being gawked at in public all indicate a negative perception of oneself. The mention of feeling ill when imagining how others perceive them and the desire for cosmetic surgery further demonstrate a deep dissatisfaction with their appearance. The overall tone of hopelessness, self-hatred, and feeling undeserving suggests a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Questioning the legitimacy of a friendship (very long post) Alrighty. Buckle up, because this post is going to be long. There's gonna be a lot of information tossed at you, so if you're feeling like demolishing a massive wall of text, read on. A couple years back, I got my first real job. It was great. The people, the work, everything. I become friends with a waitress, which is kind of usual seeing as I've never been able to make friends with a woman before and she's a bit older than me, but that's beside the point. We hit it off as soon as we start working shifts together and talked constantly. She'd occasionally ask me to come out to eat with her, and on a couple occasions we did and both had a great time (as far as I could tell anyway). She'd also suggest that her and I should get together sometime and hang out with another waitress that's she's friends with. A few months in, my parents discover my friendship with the waitress and immediately assume the worst, e.g. I'm only friends with her for sex/drugs/alcohol, all of which aren't true. They couldn't seem to grasp that we could be just friends despite the age gap. They eventually believe that I'm telling them the truth, but not before one of them calls my boss and tells him that the waitress and I are ""dating"" but I'm too stupid to know it. This puts her in some hot water and she tells me about it the next day. My parents continue bothering me about the friendship with my coworker. In spite of this, nothing changes between the waitress and I. We still have a great time talking to each other, and I even stay at work for hours after my shift ends to talk with her. Two weeks after my parents find out about my workplace friendship, I turn 18. Suddenly my parents don't care about who I'm friends with anymore, saying that I can make my own choices now. I tell my friend that she doesn't have to worry about my parents being involved anymore, and life is good. She also tells me that she's looking for a roommate, and asks me if I'm interested. Over the course of the next six months, she makes several more offers to hang out with me and her waitress friend, only it never happens. The dates never get nailed down, or I just never hear back from her after I express interest. I chalk it up to forgetfulness or a busy schedule and leave it alone. Thanksgiving rolls around. I tell my friend that due to pressure from my parents, I'm going to have to quit working and find a full time job. She's sad at first but is still determined to spend time with me despite the fact that I'm quitting. I start my new job and hear nothing from her over the course of two months. This isn't unusual, seeing as we never communicated outside of work before, but I think it's a little strange considering that she was so determined to spend time with me when I said I was quitting. I stop by work on my day off and she nearly knocks me over when she comes to give me a hug. This is completely unexpected by me because even though we talked a hell of a lot, we never really had any physical contact. She tells me how much she's missed me and had no one else to talk to, and if I'm going to the Christmas party at the end of the month. I hang around for a few hours while we chat and leave when she goes to her other job. Later that night, she texts me saying that it how it was so nice to see me and that she's going to the Christmas party and hopes to see me there. I go to the Christmas party and we have a great time playing games and cards and eating shitty pizza. We both decide to leave at the same time and she gives me a ride home along with a couple other coworkers. We don't talk again at all until she texts me at work a month later asking if she can borrow some money. I leave and come give her the money, thinking that it's kind of weird that we've been friends for over a year and I'm just now seeing what her house looks like. We talk for way too long considering that I'm supposed to be at work, but enjoy ourselves anyway. Later that week, I stop at work on my day off and talk to her for a while before leaving for unrelated reasons. Another month passes with no communication before I stop to see her again, and this time she hardly"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post primarily expresses feelings of confusion and uncertainty regarding a specific friendship. The poster recounts their experiences with a coworker turned friend and mentions several instances where plans to hang out or spend time together fell through. While there may be a hint of disappointment or frustration in the post, it does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, low self-esteem, or other strong emotional indicators commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post seems more focused on seeking advice and expressing thoughts rather than conveying a deep sense of emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I’m ready to be okay with being alone... I want to be okay with being alone. Physically and mentally. Some days I can go home from work and be okay... but most days I can’t.

Reasoning: The post contains several strong indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a deep longing to be okay with being alone, but consistently feels sad, upset, and cries for no apparent reason. They express thoughts of wishing to not exist anymore and feeling unsure about continuing with life. The mention of feeling less important to their friends and wanting to be able to be on their own without needing them suggests a lack of self-worth and a struggle with interpersonal relationships. The loss of their mother and the significant impact it has had on their relationship further adds to their emotional distress.

"Consider this post: ""Even if someone says something nice to me, I can't bring myself to believe it was genuine. I can't wrap my head around the idea of someone actually believing anything positive about me. To me they must be doing it out of pity. Depression is like a filter.

Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of self-doubt and negative self-perception. The poster states that even when someone says something nice to them, they cannot believe it is genuine and instead attribute it to pity. This indicates a significant lack of self-esteem and a distorted perception of reality, which are common symptoms of depression. The mention of depression acting as a filter that turns any positive stimulus into something negative further supports the presence of depressive symptoms. Overall, the post reflects a pessimistic and negative mindset regarding oneself, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Young father looking for new pen-friends Sup guys, not sure that chose correct section. Two years ago i became husband and father. So since that moment i lost connection with all my friends, cause they still single and all the time hang out in night clubs and also made focus on my career.

"Consider this post: ""hot and cold friend I do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time. Some of them have developed into stronger friendships (we bond on more than just gaming). I became close with one guy in particular and I'd say he's become one of my best friends. We met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation, we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and IM. Initially, we texted all the time but I've been noticing very recently, his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent. I get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but I feel like things have changed. I had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate; always asking about my day, initiating conversations, and just being a kind friend in general. If it's been a couple of hours and i haven't replied, he'd message me to check up. I admit it was a bit intense at first but I had gotten used to it and reciprocated. But now that he's kind of dropped off, I feel like I am becoming overbearing and that's the last thing I want to be. I feel like I'm putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days. I've brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just aren't what they used to be. On top of that, I am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me...I don't nearly game as much as he does so when I do come online, we usually play games together. Sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more, we game with each other. We don't really play in groups much because he's a bit of an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable in large group settings. The other day, I was invited to play with a friend we made online. Prior to this, my friend and I had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early. But me not wanting to play with our new friend alone, i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me...but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird. Eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so I was happy by the time I called it a night and found that all of them were bonding. These incidents have happened a handful of times in the past month and it's left me slightly annoyed and very confused.""

He is up at 2:30 every morning and comes home around 5:00. Just this morning, they had an 8-mike ruck March. His leadership isn’t the best and kind of leave a lot to my husband because he’s the type that just gets stuff done. His supervisor leaves at random times of the day. Yesterday he left work at around 2pm saying it was his mother-in-law’s birthday and had to take her out for dinner. I say all this to ask what are some things I can do to help my husband? To alleviate the workload?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""[Serious]I broke a close friends heart and now i don't know what to do? [Serious] So i've been friends with this girl for around 4 years and we got really close for the past 1 year. I started having problems with other friends family and uni like 3 months ago. Basically a depressive state. And i started to treat this friend badly during these months. Sometime i would realize it and go ""sorry i've been treating you bad for the last couple of days because of etc etc"" And she always went it's okay i can understand you. For the last 2 weeks i realized that she started ignoring my texts and stuff. I waited 5 days for a reply to a single text. At the end i got mad and texted her again saying ""I don't know what to think of you anymore"" Then she replied to that with a long text blaming me for stuff and how i've changed, how we didn't get to know each other properly etc. and a few other stuff that she got completely wrong idea of. I replied with a long message explaining everything to her but she didn't reply to it. We haven't talked for a week. Today i wrote a handwritten letter to her and im planning to send it to her tomorrow. It's a 3 page long letter explaining how sorry i am, how i ruined stuff and telling how much i love her and how much i want her to forgive me. ( i know it sounds bad in sentence but it's actually a very touching letter ) Do you think i should send it?

"Consider this post: ""Can we talk about personal hygiene, or lack of there of I really can’t even remember the last time I showered, and it’s not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch I just don’t want to? I mean, I don’t like feeling dirty or like I smell bad, but the thought of getting in the shower, bathing, washing my face, getting out, putting lotion on , etc. just sounds like to much work. The most I can do is brush my teeth, but other than that I lay in bed. I mean I can get up to do things that I like on a good day like painting, but for the most part I lay in bed all day. I don’t want to feel like a nasty bitch of that I’m an “unkempt” girl but at the same time I feel like I can’t help it.

"Consider this post: ""I get depressed, so I procrastinate, so I get more depressed, etc. I hate my job with a burning passion but I can't bring myself to quit or do anything else. My job is ""prestigious"" and high-paying so it's the only thing that makes me look successful to family and friends, which makes it the only tiny source of self-worth I have. If I lost my job, everyone would know the useless, depressed piece of shit I really am. I fucking despise my job though, so I can't bring myself to actually do the work. I procrastinate for hours/days and only get anything done by pulling all-nighters right before deadlines. I could have an assignment for two weeks and I will still do it from 2:00 am to 7:00 am the night before it's due. The procrastination makes me even more depressed, anxious, stressed, etc., which makes me even less interested in doing my work. I know I would be less miserable if I got my shit together, but I just can't make myself do it, and then I hate myself even more. Vicious cycle continues. I've tried every trick in the book to stop procrastinating but nothing works. Anyone else deal with this?""

"Consider this post: ""I wish I could have done things differently I graduated high school in June of 2015. Currently I am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although I don't know how long I can keep it up. Back in high school I didn't try as hard as I could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university. Freshmen year of high school I saw my lowest gpa ever I had gotten a 1.8 gpa in the 2nd semester of that year. Hell I was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that I could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but I ended up getting caught. If the university applications saw that I got a D in an art class they would have thought I was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university. It was because of my second semester of freshmen year that I thought my chances of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT/SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The following years in hs I've managed to improve a bit but not all that much. After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my cards right I'll be able to graduate by he end of May in 2019 and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I can't help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I don't have any friends right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friends at this point. Right after high school I didn't really have any second thoughts and what I was doing. I was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I can't help but feel that I've made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshmen year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I'm only 21 and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better. I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now. I honestly hate everything about myself and wish that I could just go back and make things right in high school."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a significant level of regret, self-blame, and feelings of worthlessness. The poster expresses a strong desire to have done things differently in the past, particularly in high school, and blames themselves for their current situation.

These emotions indicate a low self-esteem and a sense of hopelessness about their current circumstances. The post also hints at a lack of social connections and loneliness, as they mention not having any friends currently and believing that attending a university out of high school would have allowed them to have friends by now.

"Consider this post: ""I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited I'm unsure how to feel. I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California. My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class. I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently. I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation. Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid. I am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren't even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I'm paying for myself!). My mom said she's busy with work and has to coordinate a lot. She always says ""maybe next summer we'll make a trip out there!"" I'm the first person in my family to graduate college and it's kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own. I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday. I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me. It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him. I was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not. I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it. They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live. It's been six years! My mom just bought a house so I know she's at least had some money for a $300 plane ticket. What should I do? Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine? Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me? Should I beg them to come to my graduation/party (I've already asked several times). I feel so awkward making up excuses for them all the time (my friends often ask when my family is coming to visit). Thanks!""

I will be turning 18 soon and I plan on moving out of my dad’s house to move in with my mom and change schools for my senior year. I essentially plan on cutting complete contact with him as he has outlived his usefulness and we have not got along anyway however I do have a few questions I wanna bring up that some of you may be able to answer. - He is currently in possession of important documentation I don’t want him to have such as various copies of important things like birth certificate, social security, medical stuff, etc. I plan on swiping these anyway from him. However, I want to know if he can legally withhold the info from me. -Can he ever at anytime get copies of various personally information of mine without me knowing or without my consent as an adult? -He said in the past you are still a minor if one is still in high-school. This is probably a stupid question but I will ask it. -When I go to enroll into a new high-school would I need anyone or since I am 18 could I just do it myself.

"Consider this post: ""Should we be angry at our parents for forcing us to suffer through their deaths? People always say ""no parent should have to bury their child"", yet our parents didn't care that by having us, we'd have to bury them and suffer through their deaths. This is selfish, and assumes love only runs one way, as if sons and daughters cannot have a strong love for their parents. Shouldn't we be angry at our parents for only being concerned with their own suffering?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a sense of anger and resentment towards parents for their mortality and for not considering the emotional burden their death would impose on their children. This suggests a deep sense of emotional pain and potentially unresolved grief.

"Consider this post: ""My cat just got hit by a car I can't even think about it too much. My family is a little sad but are kinda telling me to get over it. I've been in such a terrible depressive spell for the last few weeks and this just ruined everything. When older pets die by natural causes I don't cry as much as because I know we gave them the best life and they lived very long but my suki was only 2 years old she was so fat and adorable and I can't believe she is gone just because of a bad driver. She always came to me when I was upset she'd lay on top of me and snuggle. I wish I had more time with her. now I have almost nothing that makes me smile"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses deep sadness and grief over the loss of the poster's cat. They describe feeling devastated and that the loss has worsened their already terrible depressive state. The mention of not being able to think about it too much and feeling that everything has been ruined suggests an overwhelming emotional distress.

The lack of anything that brings them joy or makes them smile also indicates a significant level of emotional suffering. The overall tone and content of the post align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Is my sister (31) a toxic person, am I (28m) overreacting? Should i confront her or should i talk to a specialist for a peace of mind? Hello, 28 male. I'll try to be as brief as possible. I've never been very close with my sister. We talk and communicate and help each other (lately I'm the one helping) but I've never really... connected with her. In a few words - if she wasn't my sister I would've never consider her a friend or someone worth keeping close to me. As a child she was very abusive (maybe not the best word) in terms of getting what she wanted - tantrums, fights, screaming, being the centre of attention - you name it. Later on in her teen years she had constant fights with our parents over staying late at parties and so on. She was grounded more than a handful of times during that period. Over the years her attitude stayed the same. She has no qualms about burning bridges with people. Friends, family - you name it. If she gets in a fight with someone she would never stop and think twice before saying something that she may regret later on. Like an animal that's being threatened - bite, bite, bite. This would often lead to tentions in our family as she and the other party won't speak for couple of weeks. She has a child now (1.5y.o.) and the poor kid is truning out to be a real brat. We would go over to her house and the kid is throwing tantrums all over the place. She says ""well, he wants to sleep"" but won't go to the other room with him. In the meantime the kid is touching the food, throwing forks and we are all trying to keep all the food, beverages, our phones and what not away from him and she would say somehthing like: ""well, yea, the fun of being a parent. You'll see when you have one, ha ha"". Such a fun. And she is really obsessive. She's the one that does the talking. At this point I know everything about pregnancy, childbirth, brestfeeding, nutrition, whats good and whats bad for the kid. She and the kid are in every conversation. Some one would say ""I didn't get to clean the house this weekend"". Well guess what? She didn't get to clean the house too, because of the kid. ""Wow, house cleaning... Yeah, haven't done that in a while now. But you really can't, once you have a kid. You'll see"". She is lacking friends and communication, I can tell. All she talks about is some Facebook groups with other mothers that we don't know. We have never heard of them, we are not bothered to but here we are - we know about some random mom and her kid's sleep schedule, eating habits, inside jokes we don't really appreciate or care to. And if its not her and the kid in the centre of attention its her and my BIL fighting over stupid, stupid shit that I don't want to hear or know about. And its not only me - my gf, our parents, mutual friends and so on. We are so deep in that shit, that some of our mutual friends are making excuses to avoid them. And my sister's answer? ""Oh, they'll see! Things are gonna change between us and them. I'll see them when they have a kid"" We (me and my GF) are avoiding them too, as much as possible! But if you confront her you better be ready to go to war. She can't handle critisism. To her this means a fight. And if get in a fight with her you better be ready for a throwdown and to hear some bad shit about yourself. Thruth is I don't want to confront her to spare my self all the drama. The yelling, the tantrums, her playing the victim how hard it is, seeking support and involving my mother for example.... It probably is hard. Sure is. But after more than six months of me helping them with their house renovation, using my car as a truck or taxi, depending on what they need (building materials, groceries, doctor appointments etc you name it) I'm kinda sick of it and lost! I really can't tell - am i overreacting over this? If not - should I confront her and hope that she will"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes feeling disconnected from their sister and expresses feelings of not considering her a friend or someone worth keeping close to them.

"Consider this post: ""I don't trust my in-laws with my daughter. I just don't. It's hard to explain. Maybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I'm old-fashioned. Bottom line is: Their lifestyles, comments to me, comments about my kids, bad tempers, alcohol intake, drug use, and pasts instill in me no confidence that they can be responsible caretakers of my daughter. I hear so many stories of child abuse -- sexual abuse, especially. From family members, most often. I'm just not comfortable taking that risk. I'm not afraid to offend my in-laws. But other family members say I'm being unreasonable. What's a healthy perspective here? Does every parent have these fears? Am I being unreasonable? Should I trust my instincts?""

"Consider this post: ""friendship over wedding im Not sure if it is appropriate to end a friendship because I wasn’t invited to a wedding but everyone else in the group of friends were and I didn’t even know about it. She did not even bother telling me. This was a very special friend to me and I would tell her everything about me back in college and she was the most important person to me. I tried keeping in contact after she graduated by texting her at least once a month etc. but she would hardly ever respond. It seemed as if I was making much more of an effort than she was. When I found out that I wasn’t invited but everyone else in our group was, she hurt me in a way so deeply that she could never understand. She did tell me that I was on her list of people she wanted etc. when I found out, because she was that important to me, I couldn’t eat, sleep or study for my liscening boards for over a week. I lost seven pounds over one week, I called my psychologist a couple of times, cried endlessly. And it really hurt to know that maybe we weren’t as close as we once were. I am not sure if you can understand how I really felt. I’m not even sure if it’s appropriate to place it in a thread like this. I’m not sure if it was appropriate for me to end a friendship due to this situation?

"Consider this post: ""Desperately want to WANT TO get better Attempted suicide May 1st, wasted a week of my life in “voluntary” inpatient, was put on the one drug that has ever helped me (olanzapine, an antipsychotic) which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again. Was able to drag myself through some intensive outpatient group therapy for a while and then quit that too. The only good thing I have left in my life is my fiancé. I know it’s not healthy to live for another person but I’m not exactly in a position to nitpick. At this point all I can do for them is try to be as reliable as possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they don’t have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle. But I want more? I want to be able to grow with them and be an active part of a life they enjoy? I want to repay them for all the things they do in vain to try to make me happy? But all of my options in recovery range from extremely corny (literally all talk therapy, individual and group, dbt to cbt to emdr) to actually detrimental to my health (reactions to and side effects from medications). What the fuck do I do so I don’t lose the last good thing I have?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

They said it would be $250. If it was me I would've offered to pay 100% right away. Should I ask her to pay? Should I get her insurance involved?

"Consider this post: ""I made it so much worse Hey guys, haven’t been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent events have changed that. So, I’ll start with some background, I’m a 17 year old high school student. My best friend is 17 too, (Who will be referred to as Golf from now on) We didn’t even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friends and we just... connected. It’s one of those friendships where it doesn’t really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it’s like we’re family. It’s the only way I can describe it. Anyway, we’re dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group knows Golf has depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I’ve been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making jokes about offing myself. I didn’t know Golf had it until a couple months ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of times in fact. But they’re honestly useless, so it didn’t help. It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They didn’t tell me for whatever reason. I still haven’t figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I didn’t eat anything since breakfast, and that was noodles. As I’m just now typing this I realize that I’m at around 30 hours without food now. But that’s not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parents and is going to go to therapy/counseling. It was an awful day yesterday, a couple of events made Golf’s depression way worse for him. I’m glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself. But it’s my fault, I know it is. I don’t need you guys telling me how it isn’t either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated as a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I don’t know what to do. Hell, I don’t know why I made this post at all. I don’t know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there’s someone else out there who has gone through something like this. Right now he’s on a trip with his mom and dad golfing. Golf (the activity) is one of the few things he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break. I don’t want to take any attention away from Golf. He deserves it more than I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore. (I’m sorry for the rambling and any punctuation/grammar errors)."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses intense feelings of guilt and self-blame, stating that they believe it is their fault for making their friend's depression worse. They further express self-hatred and a desire to withdraw from the outside world, indicating a lack of self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness. The loss of appetite and acknowledgment that they haven't eaten in 30 hours suggests a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, which is a common symptom of depression. The overall tone of hopelessness, desperation, and uncertainty about what to do suggests significant emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Hello Hi, I just wanted to post a hi for some reason, I'm not having a good week, its a little bit bad week and I'm feeling sad, so hi!""

"Consider this post: ""I miss my mom... Ever since I was put into foster care, all I ever wanted was to bring my family together again. I wanted to build a future good enough to stay with my mother again. Instead I graduated with a shitty degree, no future, more debt than I can handle, and no real way to start improving this future. I'm 30 years old and I still cry myself to sleep thinking about my mom and all the pain she is in. I think about how much of a failure I've become and I wish I had never existed. She had a choice to get rid of me and choose not to thinking something good might come of this. My very existence not only ruined her life but gave myself no future or desire to live in the first place. So why am I still here? I just want it to end. I just want to see her one more time and then let it all end."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

"Consider this post: ""I'm annoyed and tired of living with my brother I have lived with my brother while I'm in college. Ever since I moved in, he has never washed the dishes or swept or mopped or clean anything really. He will only wash the dishes when I'm back home for breaks, and that's because there's no one else to do it for him. Every time my parents come and visit us, I'm the one who has to clean the whole apartment. He doesn't help me with any of that. One time I just snapped because my parents were coming to visit us and I had been cleaning the apartment all day and she wanted me to wash his sheets and clean his bathroom and I said no, if there's one thing he can do when he gets home from work it's take the time to clean his bathroom and wash his sheets. My mom bitched at me because I wouldn't do it. But I'm just so tired of having to do everything myself. In case anyone asks, yes, I do pay my half of the rent with my own money. So it's not fair. I just don't know what to do anymore because I don't like saying things that might make me seem like I'm being dramatic or bratty to my parents. And they know he doesn't clean anything. They know I do it all by myself but they don't ever say anything to him. My parents are just so controlling too. They don't even let me drive anywhere out of town by myself and they sure as hell won't let me live anywhere else. I still have until December when I'll finish school that I'm still gonna have to live with my brother. I'm just so frustrated and don't even know what to do anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and exhaustion from living with the poster's brother and having to take on all the household chores. The poster feels resentful towards their brother for not contributing and towards their parents for not addressing the issue. There is a sense of feeling overwhelmed and trapped in the current living situation. However, while there is some emotional distress evident in the post, it does not reach the level of very severe depression. The primary focus is on the frustrations of the living situation and the lack of support from family, rather than exhibiting the profound hopelessness, despair, or lack of enjoyment in life commonly associated with severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""I lost my job, i'm in the worst place i have ever been, and nothing makes sense or feels fair. I have worked at the same place for nearly three years. It's an entry level retail job, but i haven't ever had anything else, so it was really the only thing that made me feel validated. Recently, for the fifth time i got passed up for a promotion, but this time marked the end. The girl who got promoted over me is one of my best friends in the world. She is absolutely amazing, and i am so happy for her, but it was the hardest to accept. She started about a year ago, and i helped train her and build her up. Fairly quickly, we became the face of the job that we did. She was my partner in everything, and i feel like i would be there for the things she couldn't do, and she would be there for the things i couldn't do. Seeing her success is the most proud i have ever been, but it's made me the most miserable. I basically found out that after busting my ass for over two years, my partner was going to be my boss. I hate that. I lost the person that was my rock in the things that i did. I don't want to work under her, i wanted to be there with her. She told me when it happened out of respect for me, and i turned in my resignation the next day. Now the only thing that made me feel validated and gave me security is gone, and i don't know what to do. My friend understood everything of course. More than just being my partner in work, she was the only person who could tell when things got really bad for me. When i hide how miserable i am, she's the first person to notice, and the only person who understands and will tell me what i need to hear. If there is any upside to all of this, it's that at least i still have my friend. In my overthinking and fear, i guess i was afraid this would change things. I learned pretty fast how much care and respect she holds for me, and i don't think anything will change that. I hope not. This job was beating me down. I trained a lot of our best staff, and i had a lot of associate come to me before management, feeling like i was more of a leader to them than our actual leadership was. We lost a lot of people due to burnout and frustration with management, but i know that i always cared about the people i got to train and help, and took a lot of pride in their success. Even after getting underpaid, undervalued, and shafted at every turn, i always stayed because i cared about the people i worked with and i wouldn't give up on them. One would think that leaving a shit situation would make me happy, but it just doesn't. Despite my 2+ years retail and leadership experience, it's been hard to find another job. Most people offer me less money than i made before (not much) and basically completely ignore any qualifications i actually have. I am in school. I finish community college this year and will move to a four year school assuming i can as my performance isn't amazing. I I want to pursue grad school to gain qualifications as an industrial/org psychologist, but everything seems so far away. I feel like with being a Psych major i'm just going to end up equally as useless with a four year degree, and even if grad school does work out, that's overall another four years from now. I have to pay bills, and i hate feeling so useless. I'm not going to starve and die or anything. My family has money, and has offered to help me pay bills if i can't find a job, but that just makes things worse in a way. I moved away from home because i wanted to be my own person. It has been three years and i haven't had to ask for help from anybody. I hate the thought that i will have to rely on these people who have given me everything to give me more. It isn't their fault that i'm a fuck up. A man said to the universe: “Sir, I exist!” “However,” replied the universe, “The fact has not created in me A sense of obligation.” - Stephen Crane I know that life isn't fair.

They mention losing their job, which was a source of validation and security, and feeling devastated by the fact that their friend got promoted over them. They describe feeling alone and lacking support, as well as feeling useless and like a failure. The mention of not finding joy in activities they usually find pleasurable, such as playing video games, suggests a loss of interest or pleasure, which is a common symptom of depression. They also mention struggling with the idea of asking their family for help, which may indicate low self-esteem or negative self-perception. The overall tone of the post is one of deep emotional distress and a sense of being overwhelmed by negative emotions, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""How to function properly when you realize there's no such thing as life? I'm depressed but I have no sad story to tell (just an uneventful one). I fail at everything and turn everyone down mostly because I was tormented for years by the absurdity of it all. I don't care if me dying will affect anyone. Someone's ""recovery from depression"" doesn't concern me neither. We're just complex preprogrammed machines creating illusions to survive and reproduce, to seek pleasure according to the program. We're part of the universe and shit, cool, so what? It's not even about the pain anymore. Why keep going when life doesn't exist? But if I do stay for a while, how do I even function properly when I'm stuck with this in mind?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of existential despair and hopelessness. The poster describes feeling depressed and having a lack of motivation and purpose in life. They express a lack of interest in other people's well-being, which can be indicative of a depressed state. The mention of being tormented for years by the absurdity of life suggests a prolonged struggle with these feelings.

"Consider this post: ""I [22/m] and a friend of mine [20/m] had a dispute which questions our friendship. TL;DR, OP misread the situation by telling a joke to which his drunk friend took offence and revealed to OP's other friends OPs 3-year buried drug habit. OPs friends now know things OP originally wanted to be left in the past. ********* My friend (let's call him T, for now) and I had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other. T was very drunk and gave some information I kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time. He mentioned the last time I got high, but he did mention how long ago. This is important because Ive had an on and off history of depression which I've been struggling with years, and I previously I used to combat it by developing a drug habit. I've been working hard to be clean for 3 years, and I've kept all this under the rug because I didn't wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible, or be denied respect as their friend. I buried my past and drug habits for good, doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing I felt I like I myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time. He did all this because I had made a joke in this particular conversation, to which he reacted negatively, and said I ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so. Because of this, people I trust now are asking me if I do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me. Some people I'm friends with are asking me if I need counselling though I'm clean. I'm not sure if I can forgive him and it's made me feel less than a person, which is something I haven't felt in 3 years. I feel worthless again and I'm not quite sure I can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life. Should I cut ties with T? What should I do if now my other friends might not see me the same way anymore?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The poster may be suffering from depression. The post exhibits a profound sense of emotional distress, self-doubt, and feelings of worthlessness. The mention of a history of depression and struggle with drug habits suggests underlying mental health issues. The poster expresses a loss of identity and fear of being judged by their friends, leading to a decrease in self-worth. The overwhelming emotions of feeling worthless again, uncertainty about mending friendships, and contemplating cutting ties with T all indicate a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Can't relate or make friends with anyone my age 19 years old, just got out of highschool. Anyways, I'm a chill dude, good looking, and sociable. Anyways, I have trouble making any fucking friends with dudes my age (no trouble with girls). I'll vibe with them really well at first and play sports or whatever with a few of them. They seem pretty friendly but at the same time some of their other friends seem to kind of hate me even though they act polite when interacting with me. I can even hear them talk shit sometimes from a distance even tho there's no personal beef and most of them haven't spoken more than a sentence to me b4? however they won't directly confront me and at least be upfront. Literally even in highschool I'd have dudes try to test me and start shit with me though I didnt even know them lol fuck this shit, is every kid my age a fuck boy? I met a few chill ppl, but damn most of them seem like insecure cunts...it's just making me hate ppl more and myself more.""

The poster describes having difficulty making friends with people their age and expresses confusion and hurt over being treated poorly by some individuals. They also mention feeling disliked and targeted for no apparent reason.

"Consider this post: ""I'm not afraid of dying alone. Im afraid of living alone. Does anyone know who wrote this. It is not be word for word. I really connect with this."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a fear of living alone rather than a fear of dying alone. This suggests a underlying sense of loneliness and the need for connection. The poster also mentions feeling a strong connection with a quote or saying that reflects their own emotions and experiences.

While the post does not directly mention depression, the focus on fear, loneliness, and a search for connection aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I'm winning this battle today I ordered groceries, pretty much all produce. I WILL NOT let them go bad. I'm doing laundry today. I'm showering today and brushing my hair. I just might even mow my back yard (not likely, but it's fun to dream) I'm not letting my depression best me today."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests that the poster is battling depression. While they express determination and motivation to complete tasks such as ordering groceries, doing laundry, showering, and possibly mowing the lawn, they also mention that it is a battle.

Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on the actions and behavior of the friend's partner, rather than expressing personal emotional distress or symptoms of depression. While there may be some level of frustration or concern for the friend's decision-making, it does not indicate a deep sense of hopelessness or despair. The tone of the post is more casual and lighthearted, with the poster seeking validation or opinions about their friend's situation. Overall, the emotional indicators present do not align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I just don't know how to deal with this shit anymore. I can remember being depressed and having anxiety as early as 15 years old (31 now). I'm sure I have been happy some time along the way but I can't remember. I think most of the ""good"" times were just when I had enough energy to pretend and delude myself and convince everybody around me that I was normal and healthy. Unfortunately, as time has gone on my times of stability have gotten shorter, and my major depressive episodes have only gotten much worse, and lasted longer. I've dropped out of 4 different colleges and have quit every job I have ever had, most of them with literally no notice. I have seen doctors, I've been on different medications with no noticeable effects. I am see a doctor now, but am hoping to get in to see a psychiatrist or mental health specialist soon, but that could be a month or two away at this point. I am just completely exhausted at this point and don't know how much longer I can take it. My parent just keep telling me I need to get a job, like that would make everything better. It definitely doesn't help that they try to get me to go to church with the every other week or ask me all the time if I have met any girls that I'm interested in. They can't understand that just taking a shower on any given day or leaving the apartment to buy groceries is a monumental task. They ask if I am suicidal, as if that is the only way to tell how severe my depression is. I don't consider myself suicidal, but I no longer have a desire to continue living. Every day I wake up is another disappointment, another day of being incapable of doing anything and feeling sorry for myself. I'm pretty sure the main reason that I'm not suicidal is that I am convinced that I would fail or just wouldn't be able to go through with it and the embarrassment would be too much to handle. As much as my family frustrates me, I understand that they are trying to help but they just don't know how. They have supported me financially on several occasions before now. Without their help I would almost certainly be homeless or dead by now. All I want is to not feel this way anymore. Every time I leave my apartment I am tense and in fear of the people around me. I escape for social situations as soon as possible only to get home and feel completely worthless. I can accept that I will always live with this illness, that it is never going away. I just want to find a way to make it bearable"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a multitude of emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a long history of depression and anxiety, and mentions a lack of memory of any happy times. They express a feeling of having to pretend and delude themselves to appear normal to others. The mention of dropping out of college and quitting jobs without notice suggests difficulties with functioning and maintaining stability. The poster also mentions not finding relief from different medications and expresses a desire to see a mental health specialist. The feeling of exhaustion, hopelessness, and thoughts of not wanting to continue living are prominent throughout the post. The mention of tension and fear in social situations, feeling worthless, and the constant struggle to make life bearable align with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Try to stop identifying with your thoughts Dude, I know how it is to be depressed. I know how it is to be sick and tired of being sick and tired. Tired of the hate, tired of being tired of the hate, tired of being tried of being affected by the hate.

Currently im numb because of anti depressants and possibly supressing so many thoughts in my young life. But i felt peace, i felt pleasure. So I KNOW those are real. Just try. What do you got to lose? Check out Eckhart Tolle or Noah Elkrief on youtube."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of being depressed and exhausted, as the poster describes feeling sick and tired of being affected by hate and being in a constant state of fatigue. The mention of being on antidepressants and feeling numb suggests a struggle with mental health. Despite this, the poster also mentions finding peace and pleasure through focusing on their breath and mentions resources to check out for more information. Though the tone is not as despairing as the previous example, the post still indicates a level of emotional distress and a history of dealing with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I feel so lost Hi. I'm 15 year old girl from India and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Everybody is passionate about something right? I'm not. I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do. I have tons of friends at school but I've never connected with anyone. There was this one guy I was really good friends with and had a crush on since 6th grade but he changed schools last year and we lost touch. I've tried making actual new friends since then but it's never clicked with anyone. There are good days and bad days, the latter consisting of me drawing all the curtains in my room, turning off the lights, wrapping myself in my blanket and just laying there in the dark. It embarrasses me to admit that that is what I'm doing right now. I really want to go to college in the US just to experience something new for once but med school is really expensive. I just want to feel happy about something for once. Why does nothing interest me anymore? I feel like a robot going through the same routine everyday. Eat, study, sleep, repeat. I just want to be happy."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly reflects emotional pain and a sense of hopelessness. The poster expresses feeling lost, lacking passion or excitement, and being terrified of the future.

It shows I'm not fit to be in a relationship with anyone or my depression will make me feel like I'm in so much pain. Then I also hate being alone like it would just be nice for one day to be hugged all day by a guy. I would feel more relaxed and just forget about so many things.""

One time we had them over and we’re going to drop them off and well they got mad because we couldn’t keep them. They always want him to be there for them like if he’s the father and he’s not his just the uncle. And I don’t like when he brings them over because it’s like they don’t even acknowledge I am here. The kids don’t like me and it’s noticeable I guess they’re mad because I took their uncle away.

It primarily focuses on a specific issue related to the poster's husband's family dynamics and their concerns about the relationship between the poster's husband and his niece and nephew. While there is some anger and frustration expressed, it is related to the dynamics within the family and the poster's concerns about their future children, rather than reflecting profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression.

"Consider this post: ""I hate my mum I dislike my mum. In fact, I’m disgusted with her and feel rage sometimes. She acts fake towards me, meanwhile behind my back, she complains and gossips about me. She hates when I talk to my dad at all because she thinks we’re rivalling against her which isn’t true. When I confront her with things she’s said, she says, ‘I never said that. Stop pinning me down. You’re lying. I never lie. I’m perfect.’ And she is religious. This one year I asked if I could see a therapist and she refused until I told her my reasons which she was the reason mainly. Then I told her something else and then she would deliberately ignore me and get mad every time I’d ask again. Until like, 1 year went by and she said I have to have a therapist who is the same religion which I’m not even. She went psycho this one year and yelled, slapped my older sister, threw plates at all of us until we’d run outside to our backyard. And I’ve tried being honest with her. I told her I had some serious trouble at school with bullying and she knew who it was and said to me, ‘they’re always nice to me. I don’t believe you.’ And she never talks with me about how I’m doing or even made dinner when I was younger so I’m still underweight. And she gets mad at every honest thing I say because I’m just kinda frank. My oldest sister has rebelled against her and stuff but yet, she still is a heartless person. And when I’m away from ‘home’ she won’t ever text or call me and then when I return ‘home’ she’ll yell at me and accuse and manipulate me. She’ll say, ‘is it really that hard to send a text?!’ Meanwhile she never does. And she manipulated my dad and ever since I was 7, she’s wanted to divorce my dad and it’s sad because my family is so split, all my dad wants is to just have dinner as a family but that’s too hard. And my ‘mum’ blames my dad for the split of the family. I hate my mum, don’t care about my older sister, but I like my oldest and younger sister and my dad.""

Reasoning: The post contains several indicators of emotional distress and negative feelings towards the poster's mother. The language used is strong, expressing hatred, disgust, rage, and feelings of being manipulated and misunderstood. The mention of the mother's fake behavior, gossiping, and refusal to allow the poster to see a therapist and manipulate the situation to align with her religious beliefs adds to the sense of emotional turmoil and distress. The overall tone of the post suggests significant anger, frustration, and an unhealthy family dynamic, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

"Consider this post: ""Just wanted to share Hey, first time posting here. Just wanted to talk to someone there since is not really any option irl. I just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap. Probably not news to anyone here, that's how it usually goes. But tonight I feel okay. I recently decided just to drop everything and run away (not the first time I've done it, I've gotten good at it actually) and have been just sitting while I wait for finances to become ready. This is a record low point in my life, but tonight I changed how I feel about it by just getting some chores done, getting drunk, and treating myself the way I wish other people would treat me. I'm talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80's And it dawns on me that I'll get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I've bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I'm probably going to do so again. There will be more chances to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to. I don't need someone to be nice to me, all I have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people. It's a silly sentiment but it's all I got right now, I hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it. If you pray, pray for me in the next three months because it's all I got. Ask me for some nice nice words and I'll give some to you as personally as I can. Things get better when you're kind to others. No matter what the haters might tell you."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits a mix of emotions, including feelings of self-blame, regret, and a sense of hopelessness. The poster shares that they have made poor decisions in their life and feels like a ""piece of crap."" This self-deprecating language suggests low self-esteem and negative self-perception, which are characteristic of depression. However, the poster also expresses a momentary sense of optimism and motivation to change, which indicates some potential resilience. Overall, the post conveys a combination of negative emotions and fleeting hope, but the presence of self-blame and feelings of low self-worth align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Dealing with a spiteful sister-in-law? I'm 28, and we are all living under the same roof. I live with my mom and dad, and help take care of my grandparents.. I have fibromyalgia, chronic pain, migraines 4-5 times a week and have trouble getting out of bed some days. Brother (loses jobs frequently, can never keep his wife happy) she's become a very spiteful and distant person in the last 2 years. They decided to move in March of 2016 after not getting their way of getting help from my mom (who helps everyone and is the kindest and most selfless person you will ever meet). They have 3 kids, and now a fourth one on the way in May. Brother ""Dave"" and his wife gonna call her ""Vick"". Always go back and forth at one another, as he loses jobs and they both work (she's held a stable job and he hasn't), calls him lazy, P.O.S., a horrible father, our family made her the way she is now, tells her kids to ""suck it or, or stop crying"" when they get upset or hurt. She used to be the sweetest, kindest person ever. I REALLY liked this woman, and we got along great. I could never say a bad thing about her 10 years ago. Until, I came out in 2008 as gay. She was supportive or so I thought. Then wrote a long nasty letter to me after telling my mom she didn't want me holding my boyfriends hand around her kids, that she didn't want that exposed to them, etc. I called her a hypocrite and walked off, because she did all these things with her husband and more. Nothing more, nothing less. Cause she was and I was sick of all her bull about me and her hating on the way I was. I don't say things unless something truly bothers me and I was at the last straw. Said she didn't support me being gay, me being with my boyfriend was wrong, she doesn't want her kids around it, etc. Anyway, little bits of this kept coming up over the last 9 years and slowly grew distant from her. Last one me being worried about her being mad at me for something, as she came in and didn't talk to me or respond to what I had said. I said is she mad at me? To my brother. He goes I don't think so. She then yells ""I'm not mad, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC!"" I'm like wow.. completely out of character for her. I've never done anything to her to get spoken to like this. 1 year ago -- she called my brother a piece of sh*t for the 40th time. I got tired of it, her belittling him, throwing his things, telling him that our family are horrible people for the fights we get in once every 2 months. He looked defeated, he looked the saddest I've ever seen him. I asked what was wrong, he told me. I agreed with what he had said about her letting the children use the tablets too, that it was ridiculous that she's called him something so horrible over it. I was really angry at her, disappointed with her. We had gotten into a big fight after me coming out before as well and she denied everything that happened that day. I whipped out my phone for this one -- so all the facts were here. Everything was caught on camera for the minute we got into it. After I go into my room, she comes and slams the door next to my room closed and says, ""You've got to me f'ing kidding me. Is he really siding with you. HELL NO!"" to my brother. I come out and say what's the problem? (My mistake, but no... no one in my family has ever said anything to this woman to keep the peace. They're afraid of her taking the grandchildren away and my mom loves them dearly and is afraid of having a bad relationship with her.) I say ""I'm tired of you calling my brother a piece of crap."" I yelled, ""Stop treating him like that, what the hell is wrong with you? Who says that to the person they love and are married to? Why do you belittle him so much when he's finally got a nice job. I can't believe anyone in this house doesn't say anything to you over the way you treat"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes experiencing chronic pain, migraines, and difficulty getting out of bed some days, which are physical symptoms commonly associated with depression. The mention of feeling trapped and exhausted by their living situation and expressing dislike and almost hatred towards their sister-in-law suggests a deep level of emotional distress and lack of fulfillment in their current environment. The poster also expresses discomfort, frustration, and a sense of hopelessness regarding their inability to find a job that accommodates their chronic health issues. The overall tone of the post conveys a significant level of emotional pain, exhaustion, and desperation, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Depression is the enemy you can't beat I am a fighter like I play brutal sports in college and I'm used to pain, but when it comes to depression I want to defeat it in one simple step but it's not that easy. I go through days where I feel better knowing that there's nothing for me to screw up. I have these feelings not only at night when I'm alone but when I'm with friends and I know that they don't understand it because I get the normal response of ""everybody feels that way man."" and that's just a worse thing for me to think about. if everyone has it I must be a failure for letting it affect me in such a way where I cant get anything done for school and I just sit on my computer all day. Its miserable."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post strongly expresses feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and despair. The poster discusses their struggle with depression and their desire to overcome it quickly and easily, which is a common experience for individuals with depression. They mention experiencing both good and bad days, with the bad days making it difficult for them to function and causing them to isolate themselves. The mention of feeling like a failure and being unable to get anything done for school highlights a lack of motivation and self-esteem, which are common symptoms of depression. The overall tone of the post reflects a deep sense of misery and the belief that depression is an unbeatable enemy, further indicating the presence of very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""How do I know if my friend is sincere? How do I know that a friend who says that she's my friend is actually sincere? She says things like I'm one of the best people she knows. The enthusiasm is disproportionate to some of the things she's done. She's given me thoughtful gifts like chocolates, books or an adult colouring book (I like art). But when we travelled around together she put up stark boundaries - like she'd not even let me in her room to help her out with a mouse which showed up, even though she complained like she needed the help. Also, she only makes the time to reply to my messages about once per week. I can say that confidently because I know she's online most of the time on Facebook. I can see it. Has anyone got such ""friends""? Is this normal?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not indicate that the poster suffers from depression. While they express doubt and uncertainty about the sincerity of their friend, there is no strong indication of emotional distress or hopelessness. The tone of the post remains relatively objective and seeking advice rather than expressing significant emotional pain. The poster describes specific behaviors of their friend that they question, but these do not necessarily point to symptoms of depression. Overall, the post primarily focuses on the topic of friendship and seeking input from others, rather than expressing deep emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Should I cut my losses &amp; move on? I have a co-worker &amp; friend that I’ve gotten to know really well since we started working together almost 2 years ago. He seemed a bit socially awkward so I befriended him. We started hanging out &amp; we shared some pretty deep things with each other. He’s not big on emotions but he said he just feels comfortable talking to me about things. However, he’s a self proclaimed “bad” friend. He wants friendships on his rules, his terms &amp; there is no real sense of urgency in getting back to you. He’ll not text me back for days. When I check on him he tells me I shouldn’t worry (I’m a worrier by nature). He says he doesn’t owe me anything yet tells me I’m one of the only people who has ever shown him unconditional love in a friend sort of way. One of my biggest pet peeves is when people ignore me. Im sure he knows that &amp; he does it on purpose at times. But, I also know that’s just who he is based on how other co-workers talk about him at work. I can be very overbearing at times myself. I try not to be but I get really insecure about our friendship if he just ignores me; like I did something wrong to warrant being ignored??!? I just feel like this friendship is so up &amp; down. He has no regard for my feelings or how his actions make me feel. He thinks emotions are dumb. He says they just cause problems &amp; people get hurt. He literally almost never shows emotion in any situation. However, I have seen him cry before &amp; I know he is capable of loving someone. He claims he has no love to give because he has such a poor opinion of himself. I’ve never had a friendship that has been this difficult to maintain. I always feel like I’m doing something wrong. It’s like walking on eggshells. I’m thinking about just ending the friendship but we still work together. I tend to get VERY passive aggressive when I am hurt. I know I will start to get that way at work toward him while he will be as polite &amp; professional as can be because that’s how he is. He controls his emotions SO well. I just don’t know what to do... TL; DR- thinking of ending a friendship with a co-worker after becoming very close, feels like walking on eggshells."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits a range of emotions including insecurity, frustration, and confusion, but it does not strongly indicate very severe depression. The primary focus of the post is on the difficulties and uncertainties of maintaining a friendship with a co-worker. While there is a mention of feeling hurt and the potential for passive-aggressive behavior, the overall tone of the post does not convey the profound hopelessness, despair, or lack of enjoyment commonly associated with very severe depression. Additionally, the post suggests a desire for resolution or advice on how to handle the situation, rather than expressing a sense of emotional distress that is overwhelming and unmanageable."
"Consider this post: ""I don't care about my stepchild. Okay. So I've been married for about 9 months or so. My wife had a kid from someone previously before me. He is two and a half now. I've never cared about him and don't give a shit about him. I know it's not right to say but it's how I feel. I've put up with it the past 2 years because I knew it was the right thing to do for her. We want to have a baby. I want to have a child now of my own but I'm afraid that I will never care for him whatsoever and will care and love my child and never care or love him. I don't know what to do anymore. Me and my wife have never had problems in our relationship or even an arguement. It's not her or us it's me personally. I hate the feeling of not caring. I'm trying to find a solution that doesn't end up with me leaving. But what do you do when you don't care about your step child? I need a solution to this fucked it problem. I care about her. Just Not about him."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of apathy and lack of emotional connection towards the poster's stepchild. The poster explicitly states that they do not care about the child and expresses a desire to have their own child instead. This suggests a lack of interest and attachment, which may be indicative of a deeper emotional issue. However, it is important to note that this post does not provide enough information to definitively diagnose depression. The focus is primarily on the specific issue of not caring for the stepchild, rather than displaying a wider range of symptoms commonly associated with depression. Further assessment and understanding of the poster's overall emotional state would be necessary for a more accurate identification."
"Consider this post: ""Becoming fat Perhaps due to my meds (some of them have side effects pertaining to increase in appetite and weight gain), and perhaps due to my ridiculous comfort eating, I have become fat. Which is very obvious because I am short and have a small frame. Plus all my tailor made clothes don’t fit me. Exercise and the lot don’t work - in fact I’ve exercised 30 minutes or more every day in the last 1.5 month - after all I’m not a young person, I don’t do very strenuous exercise and my metabolism is probably low. So exercise itself can’t burn off the additional calories I’m consuming. So this is it - I’m stopping with the crazy eating."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of self-criticism and dissatisfaction with the poster's physical appearance and weight gain. The mention of medication side effects and comfort eating suggests a potential link between emotional distress and the change in eating habits. The poster expresses frustration with unsuccessful attempts at exercise and acknowledges the need to stop the unhealthy eating behavior. This demonstrates a level of self-awareness and a desire to make changes, but the overall tone still conveys a sense of disappointment and negative self-perception. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, specifically relating to body image and self-esteem issues."
"Consider this post: ""Close friend suddenly turned cold I have a friend who's had some mental and anxiety issues in the past. We generally chat online, although we've met up in real life a number of times, and talk on the phone sporadically. They have an issue with trust. They believe no one cares about them and that every friend they have will eventually leave them. So fairly insecure. They are currently attending therapy (have for a number of months) to help them with their anxiety. They are meditating etc. At a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their life—so as far as I know, it's not a lie. Anyway, I stepped up because I thought this person was pretty special and intelligent. I loved that they were passionate and outspoken and unique. Over time, I developed some feelings for them too but more a great love as a friend than anything too romantic. Anyhow, we grew close. We shared many things, pretty much every day, although I believe she feared that she was abusing the friendship because I would try and reassure her a lot. She asked for my advice, and I gave it without thought. When she was upset, I tried my best to calm her down and express care. When she needed a boost, I gave it to her. She was worth my time. And she did the same for me. Because she was going through a hard time in general, I did all this because she was who she was. Then...we had a couple of fights. Nothing horrible, and we supposedly worked through our problems but...I've been having my own issues recently. After the last fight, where we talked everything out on the phone and she expressed the qualities she liked about me, as a friend, and how she was afraid that doing so in the past had pushed people away...well. Now, she's cold and distant. Not 100%, but there's something sincerely off, enough to notice. Phrasing that you wouldn’t use with a friend, let alone an acquaintance. I have years and years of examples to the contrary and I’ve asked a therapist friend to have a look at the differences as well. She’s definitely changed; it's definitely not just me. Supposedly, she’s looking after her mental health. I can see how having a person there to always reassure them may lead to this person not being as eager or able to rely on themselves, but we could have worked this out. I would have supported them through it. My support was enough up until three weeks ago when something quite major occurred and upset them. Now, I get ‘Well, I suppose that’s very kind of you’ when I express concern for how she is and ‘How do I know that you’re not rolling your eyes?’ when I express that I care and ‘What possible use could I be to you’ when I tried to give her a little advice and express that she's important to me too. These are all usual parts of the conversation and nothing out of the ordinary from my side. Her manner and actions are a huge backflip, because less than a month ago she expressed how important and vital my friendship was to her because she—definitively—knew I cared about her (and suspected others didn’t). She also stated that she was going to be a better friend. Now I hear ‘I need balance in my life’, as if it was a major issue to be close to someone. The two things—better mental health/developing more of an ability to take care of oneself *and* having someone close to confide in—are not mutually exclusive. I’ve lost a decent amount of sleep over this because the support was reciprocal, so it feels like I've lost a large part of my support network. I’m looking for any opinions on what I should do here, because I’m hurting and it’s already been a bad time (of which this person is aware). I've already asked them twice what's up and the question has been turned on me both times, as if I'm the one with the issue. I don't want to cut them off because they really do mean a hell of a lot to me, but is that all I can do here? I've tried to just back way off for the moment and see if they realise what they've done on their own. P.S. This is a six-year"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals a deep sense of emotional pain and distress, as well as a strong attachment to the friend who has become distant. The poster expresses feelings of hurt, confusion, and a sense of loss. They mention losing sleep over the situation and feeling like they've lost a part of their support network. These emotions are indicative of the profound sadness and despair commonly associated with depression. However, it should be noted that the post does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether the poster suffers from depression or if their emotions are solely a result of the situation with their friend. Further context and information would be needed for a more accurate assessment."
"Consider this post: ""Should I support my bestfriends toxic relationship? My bestfriend has been dating a guy for the last 7 years, since they were in high school. She has grown into a gorgeous, and successful woman, while he is still acting like he is 17. She has been in therapy because of trust issues with her boyfriend for 5 years. She continually tells me all the terrible things he does, and how he lies non stop. I obviously want her to feel like she can talk to me about the relationship, but I am getting tired of watching her go through the same thing over and over again, and then the next day they make up. They see each other once a week, (or less). He cant afford a cell phone or a car, he drinks a lot, and he's just a loser in my eyes. He is lazy and waste his money on alcohol and smokes. She could throw a rock and find a better boyfriend but she's so invested in this relationship its disgusting. She wants to marry this guy eventually, and her excuse is that he just needs to grow up a bit. HES 26! She literally gives him chance after chance, and he continues to screw up, but she is so set on being in the relationship. I know she is more then likely scared of being alone, but after 5 years of him screwing up, you think being alone would be better then being in this one sided relationship. I have no idea what to do, I am scared if I tell her that I don't want to hear anymore about this guy, then ill be a bad friend, but I also cant stand by while this guy continues to treat her like shit, and she continues to take it. What would you do? Would you be honest? Or would you stick by your friend and continue biting your tongue?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of frustration and concern for the poster's best friend's toxic relationship. The poster describes the boyfriend's negative qualities and behavior, expressing their own exhaustion and weariness of watching their friend go through the same cycle repeatedly. The poster expresses a desire for their friend to find someone better and questions her reasons for staying in such a damaging relationship. Despite feeling conflicted about how to address the situation, the overall tone of the post does not convey the typically associated symptoms of very severe depression. The focus is primarily on the friend's relationship and the poster's struggle with how to support her rather than expressing profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues."
"Consider this post: ""I wish people that have never experienced depression could still understand. There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that's what they do. It's so fucking shit. I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they don't see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak. It's not even their fault it's just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reasons beyond your control. Why is it that any physical illness gets so much sympathy and empathy from everyone but the second it's a mental issue theres no excuse for it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of frustration, despair, and isolation. The poster expresses a strong desire for others to understand the experience of depression and highlights the lack of empathy and support they receive from people who don't truly comprehend the nature of depression. The mention of feeling like they would rather not exist and the contrast between the sympathy and empathy given to physical illnesses versus mental issues suggests a significant level of emotional distress and societal misunderstanding, both of which are commonly associated with depression. The overall tone of hopelessness, isolation, and frustration aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Friend leads much better life, I feel resentful We both just graduated, she had so many job offers, I had none save for an internship. I found a job later but I make less than half of what she makes. She got a job offer from another firm, and referred me to them when she turned them down, but I didn't get it even though the interview went great. And because she makes so much more than I do, she's always trying to get me to travel, which I can't afford since I'm saving up for grad school. She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works. She's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around. It's getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while I have nothing to compare, how shitty of a person would I be if I distanced myself from her for my own mental well-being?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of resentment, envy, and inadequacy, which can be indicative of depression. The poster compares their own situation unfavorably to their friend's, highlighting a lack of job offers, lower income, inability to afford travel, and difficulty in relationships. These experiences contribute to the poster's feelings of inadequacy and their desire to distance themselves from their friend for the sake of their mental well-being. While the emotions expressed in the post align with some depressive symptoms, the intensity and overall tone of the post do not suggest very severe depression. The focus on the impact of the friend's achievements and comparison to their own life is more specific to feelings of jealousy and self-doubt, rather than overwhelming emotional distress often associated with severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Can't remember the last time I had a good day First time poster here. Just wondering if any else has the same feeling where it seems that a shitty day turned into a shitty month which turned into a shitty year. Before I knew it, I couldn't even remember the last good day I had or even the last time something went right for me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of despair and hopelessness, as the poster describes not being able to remember the last time they had a good day or when something positive happened. This suggests a prolonged period of negative experiences and emotional distress, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post indicates a lack of optimism and a feeling of being stuck in a cycle of negativity, further supporting the label of depression."
"Consider this post: ""Maybe They are Wrong About It All We are always told ""when you are depressed, your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is"". What if they are wrong? If someone is piss poor and starving, can't pay their bills, replace their moth-eaten clothes or go out to do interesting things, surely their money situation really IS as bad as all that. If someone has no family, no friends and has been bullied/abused by everyone they've met in life, perhaps their social situation really IS as bad as all that. If someone has had lots of physical health issues like cancer, chronic pain, obesity etc, maybe their physical woes really ARE as bad as all that. Some people go through all of the above, all at once. So maybe life IS as bad as all that for them. The whole ""your brain is lying about how bad things are"" thing often just feels like ""you're just imagining your problems"". Like, I know depression etc make your brain incapable of dealing with them properly, but it doesn't mean legitimate problems don't exist and that some people's lives aren't thoroughly worthless all the same."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post contains strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a sense of hopelessness, despair, and worthlessness, stating that maybe the conventional wisdom that ""your brain is lying to you about how bad everything is"" is wrong. They argue that their financial situation, lack of social support, and physical health issues are indeed as bad as they seem. This suggests a deep-seated belief in their own suffering and a lack of hope for improvement. The post also mentions depression and acknowledges that it affects the brain's ability to properly deal with problems, but still emphasizes that legitimate problems exist and some people's lives are thoroughly worthless. Overall, the tone of the post is filled with profound emotional distress and a lack of belief in the possibility of change, aligning with symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Is it possible to fake depression? I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now. There are periods where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything. There are nights where it’s unbearable. I think about my situation: I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I can’t handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I can’t carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scars on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I shouldn’t have the right to do so.

I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to. I think I don’t even deserve to eat. I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I don’t have it.

Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a multitude of emotional indicators that align with severe depression. The poster describes feeling consistently bad for a prolonged period of time, experiencing daily crying, difficulty concentrating and collecting thoughts, extreme sadness even in happy situations, and a constant sense of exhaustion. They express feeling completely alone, having difficulty performing basic tasks, and experiencing unbearable nights. They also mention self-harm in the past and feeling disrespectful to those who truly struggle with depression. The overall tone is one of extreme self-blame, self-depreciation, and hopelessness, with a strong belief that they do not deserve happiness or even basic necessities like food. This level of emotional distress and self-perception is indicative of very severe depression."

Reasoning: The post exhibits a clear sense of longing for the past and dissatisfaction with the current state of the poster's life. They express feelings of being lost, pathetic, and regretful. They mention missing the enjoyment of activities like clubbing, spending time with friends, and having a romantic relationship. The mention of studying all day and losing friends suggests a lack of social connection and fulfillment in their current life. The use of strong language (""pathetic,"" ""regret,"" ""fucking regret every last second"") conveys intense negative emotions and self-criticism. Overall, the post displays emotional distress, dissatisfaction, and a sense of hopelessness, which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Finished my goodbye letters. Would just like to vent a little before I hang up my hat... For the last two months I went through hell with my relationship to my GF that I was planning on proposing to right before this all began. Since May she's been telling me how she's depressed and doesn't know why and that our relationship is failing because of it. I did absolutely everything I could to help even changing so many things about myself. This went on for over a month until she said we needed to take a break which we began to and for the next month we were on and off yet still living together and in my eyes things were turning around for the better. Well, June 29th I found out the reason for all this was that she was talking to a co-worker that lives down the street and began sleeping with him while I was at work. Unfortunately I snapped and went to confront the guy which she blocked the door from me leaving and I just ripped it open hitting her with the door not even thinking bruising her shoulder. 4 days later she calls the cops and 2 days after that I'm arrested for domestic battery. We were planning a life together and I've never felt so betrayed. After a couple days I began to see the light and once I did my mother had a heart attack and I can't help but blame myself for putting her through all this stress. Normally if I had family problems I would turn to Kaitlyn my GF and if I had GF problems I would speak to my mother or my brother who lives half way across the country. Well, now I have no one to turn to and I'm spiralling out of control. Last night I spent a few hours writing my goodbyes and have been collecting a variety of sleeping pills and muscle relaxers. Im gonna try and enjoy the next couple days and then I'm pulling all my money out of the bank to go find a beautiful scenery and make that my last memory. You've always been a huge help Reddit over the last few years but this is my breaking point. If convicted which I most likely will be according to my lawyer then the rest of my life is tarnished and getting a good job will be next to impossible. Hell I'll probably lose my current job once my name begins to get drug through the mud... Idk where I'm going with this just really needed to vent to someone that isn't gonna just tell me keep your chin up and things will get better like my friends and family. They just don't understand the dark place that I'm in right now. I've dealt with what I believe to have been mild depression for about the last 15 years living in a very racist area and being half fillipino and half white. I've never truly felt like I fit in anywhere and am just tired. I'm ready for peace."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple indicators of depression. The poster describes going through a difficult time in their relationship, feeling betrayed, and blaming themselves for the stress it has caused their mother. They express a sense of isolation and a lack of support from friends and family, stating that they have no one to turn to. The mention of writing goodbye letters, collecting sleeping pills and muscle relaxers, and planning to find a peaceful location for their last memory suggests a serious level of distress and potential suicidal ideation. The poster discusses the potential consequences of being convicted for domestic battery and the impact it will have on their future, indicating a feeling of hopelessness and despair. The post also mentions previous experiences of mild depression and a sense of not fitting in, suggesting a long-standing struggle with depressive symptoms. Overall, the post conveys a high level of emotional pain, desperation, and a significant risk of self-harm or suicidal thoughts, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""All of my friends annoy me I try to hang out with ‘close friends’ because I know it’s meant to be good for me. There’s probably about 4-5 people I’m close to. These are all good people who I’ve known for years, who I can be honest with about my emotions and mental health, who genuinely do care about me. On paper they’re amazing. And they are. Only I find that whenever I spend time with a friend, they end up annoying the shit out of me. Each one for a different reason. One talks about herself too much, one is too positive and gushy, one only ever talks about the past, the other only wants to hang out and drink. When I’m with them, I just find myself wishing I could be alone. I know the problem is with me, and that I’m sabotaging my relationships (as I always do and have done for many years). I feel guilty about it, especially knowing that I’m lucky to even have friends. But the truth is, I find people exhausting, and whenever I’m with them I just feel lonelier that when I’m alone. I end up getting snappy. It’s like I’m watching myself destroy my relationships but I don’t know how to stop. Hanging out with people makes me unhappy. Beginning to think I should become a hermit out in the woods on my own. I don’t know why I posted this. I suppose I just want to tell somebody."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress and dissatisfaction with interpersonal relationships. The poster expresses annoyance and irritability towards their friends, finding flaws in each one of them that make them difficult to be around. They also express a desire to be alone and a feeling of loneliness even when with others. The poster acknowledges that the problem lies with them and that they are sabotaging their relationships, indicating a level of self-awareness and guilt about their behavior. The overall tone of the post is one of unhappiness and a longing for solitude, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I am irrelevant No friends (unable to make any) No family (I don't have anybody literally) No relationships (no potential of attaining) I am the definition of a loser in modern society. The last advice I got was ""to kill myself at this point"". Just here to vent"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reflects a strong emotional pain and a deep sense of hopelessness and self-deprecation. The poster states feeling irrelevant and lacking any meaningful connections or relationships, which suggests a profound sense of isolation and loneliness. The mention of being unable to make friends and not having any family or support further emphasizes the feeling of being disconnected and alone. The mention of receiving advice to ""kill myself"" is extremely concerning and indicative of the poster's severe emotional distress. Overall, the post displays many symptoms commonly associated with depression, such as low self-worth, social isolation, and the presence of suicidal thoughts."
"Consider this post: ""I am losing myself HELP ME OUT To start of, i am such a loser that i flip out on people which include my own friends, siblings and parents, most of the time i am depressed because i dont have anyone else to hangout with.All i seek from this platform is all the help i need to be better. Little bit of background of me, I live with my parents and i hardly have any friends except 2 close ones. I feel i'm losing my only close friends because of my extreme behaviour such as getting into unnecessary fights, causing some sort of misunderstanding and blaming them for absolutely anything.Sometimes i am too caring and sometimes i am too rude. I am struggling with addiction to porn because i have no other option to make me feel happy. I have an on and off relationship with my parents and siblings because of my unpredictable behaviour. I have lost interest in life. I have lost myself. Maybe soon lose whatever i have got left. But i believe i could get better if i could get some help, maybe some of you could help me out with how to deal with the struggles i am facing. Thanks."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of self-loathing and despair. The poster describes themselves as a loser, discusses flipping out on people, and expresses feelings of depression and isolation. They mention struggling with addiction to pornography as a coping mechanism and describe their behavior as unpredictable. The loss of interest in life and feeling like they are losing themselves indicate a significant level of emotional distress. The poster acknowledges that they need help and seeks advice and support from others, suggesting that they are aware of their struggles and actively seeking solutions. Overall, the post demonstrates several symptoms commonly associated with depression, including low self-esteem, erratic behavior, and a loss of interest in life."
"Consider this post: ""I did something that made me really happy. After flunking a test, getting yelled at by a classmate. sitting alone at lunch with incredible anxiety and spilling milk on my uniform and having to go thru an hour long commute in a really hot day i get home feeling really overwhelmed with tons of homework i remember feeling very numb at the time that I just decided to turn off all the lights in my dorm and got completely naked and played my ukelele. i played my favourite song and started crying and just sang at the top of my lungs sounding like a dying whale and it lasted for like 2 hours i could feel every bit of depression and anxiety slowly leak off my body until the water bill knocked on my door."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a series of negative experiences, including failing a test, being yelled at, feeling anxious, and making a mess. The poster describes feeling overwhelmed, numb, and experiencing anxiety. However, there is a shift in the post when the poster mentions doing something that made them happy. They describe playing their favorite song on the ukelele and crying for two hours, which they feel helped them release their depression and anxiety. This indicates that the poster may be experiencing depression, as they describe feeling overwhelmed, numb, and experiencing anxiety, as well as finding relief through music and emotional release."
"Consider this post: ""My mom wants to see me... naked? Whew, so my parents moved to America from Korea and had my sister and I. They still stick to their homeland culture and tradition, but I've become accustomed to how things are done in America. Where kids have privacy and all. My mom has been pestering me to see me naked. She says it's to size me to buy bras, but I don't think so. She invades my personal privacy a lot, like butt slapping and I sometimes catch her staring at my privates. She comments on if I'm wearing a bra or not and I find it kind of creepy. I get that it may be normal in Korean culture, but I've asked her to stop since I feel uncomfortable. She said no, simply because she gave birth to me. Whenever I'm changing, she barges into my room barely even a second after knocking and stares at me when I'm semi naked. I asked her for some privacy, after all, I'm almost 13, but she rejects it. My mom made plans to go to a public bathhouse, but I told her I don't want to. She wants to drag me out and ""rub all the dead skin cells off my back"" but I feel like she only wants to see me naked. She recently got breast implants and keeps bragging about how she increased in size, and how she's regaining her youth. I'm happy that she is, but now I feel like she's shaming me for being flat. Hello? I'm 12. She tells me about how much bigger she was in comparison to other girls back then, then shows my sister her cleavage. I asked my mom if breasts define a woman, you know how she replied? Yes. If you want to fit in, yes. If you want to be able to wear todays modern clothes, yes. If you want to attract men, yes. I honestly LIKE being flat, but my mom says I'll change my mind. I respect the fact that I may, but I'm still sort of annoyed. I think she just wants to see me naked. Not as a parent, but as an inspector. I don't know if it's exactly normal in Asian culture, but I feel extremely uncomfortable. Any advice? Sorry if I sounded sorta whiney. (Also, she sneaks into my room at night when she thinks I'm sleeping without a bra)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits emotional distress and discomfort, but it does not necessarily indicate symptoms of depression. The main focus of the post is on the uncomfortable and inappropriate behavior of the poster's mother, rather than the individual's own emotional state. While the situation described is concerning and may have an impact on the poster's well-being, it does not provide enough information to conclude that the poster is suffering from depression. The tone of the post seems more frustrated and seeking advice rather than indicative of severe depressive symptoms."
"Consider this post: ""I don't think who try to kill themselves actually want to die From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments. Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it. I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both. Depression sucks, that's a fact we all know, but suicide is not the way to go. There is always another way, at least that is what I like to think"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post contains numerous indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses feelings of profound emotional pain, exhaustion, and hopelessness. They discuss contemplating suicide as a way to escape the unbearable agony they are experiencing and mention being close to attempting it. However, they also mention receiving support and love from online friends, which has given them a glimmer of hope and a reason to continue living. While there is a slight sense of positivity towards the end of the post, the overall tone and content suggest a significant level of emotional distress and a struggle with depression."
"Consider this post: ""My best is not enough. Ok, so here is the situation: I broke up with my ex five months ago. As soon as we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. 1h30min of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking 15kg (my weight at the start was 90kg, now 75kg). I also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference. The women I'm attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they won't survive just one week of my training. They can't see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself (I still find myself interesting. People, don't) and I got nearly 0 matches. Now I'm stuck in an Alcohol /Cigarette/Party/OneNightStandGirls loop and I can't get out of it. I drink so much that I can't even remember some things. I have fun, yes. But I want to have a connection with someone again. Is it asking too much? Why people don't give a chance to know me???"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of emotional distress and dissatisfaction. The poster describes putting significant effort into self-improvement, both physically and mentally, but expresses frustration that no one is noticing or appreciating their efforts. They also mention resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as excessive alcohol and cigarette use, as well as engaging in casual relationships to fill the void. The overall tone of the post indicates a deep longing for connection and a sense of rejection or isolation. These feelings align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly the feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and desperation for genuine human connection."
"Consider this post: ""Escapism and depression Sorry about the self-pity rant that's inbound, needed to get this out there somehow. This morning I was taking a shower sitting down with the lights off - I know, pretty edgy behavior, but it's my way of unwinding and resetting myself between bouts of work. I finished up a relatively escapist story the night prior. Stupidly, I had allowed myself to suspend my disbelief and got sucked into the plot. The writing wasn't even terribly good - the only reason I enjoyed myself was because I could temporarily forget my current self and take up the role of some other more relevant and admirable character. The story ended with a shoehorned but unbearably happy ending where the main character gets married, settles in with his newfound friends, and all's good for the time being. You know, the typical ""insert generic ending here"" bullshit. Fast forward to this morning. I'm in the shower and start thinking of my day to come, making mental to-do lists, and stressing about my current temporary problems. But somewhere along the line, I start thinking of the stupid story. I can't help but start comparing my life with that of the main character and think about how much I'd give just to be able to live a more meaningful, less real life. Then I start comparing myself to the character, and realize just how _useless_ I am. Like holy shit, I'm almost an adult and am still a passionless idiot who does nothing outside of schoolwork. Of course I can't lead a meaningful life, I'm not worthy of any of it. Thinking about this evidently stressed me out a bit too much, as I started puking what little I ate all over my shower floor and crying. I don't know. I enjoy escapism probably to a fault, but it's the only way for me to feel at least a little relevant. I'll probably come to terms with my role as human being #6,732,385,402 someday. Many thanks to anybody who bothered to read this wall of text."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits multiple indicators of depression. The poster describes engaging in escapist behavior as a way to unwind and escape reality. They express dissatisfaction with their own life and compare themselves to the characters in the story, feeling worthless and passionless. This self-deprecating and low self-esteem is a common characteristic of depression. The poster also mentions feeling stressed, which leads to them crying and vomiting. This intense emotional reaction suggests a high level of emotional distress. The overall tone of the post is one of hopelessness, despair, and a sense of feeling irrelevant. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."

I still feel joy and moods in life , like eating good food , cry from very sob movies , but at the end of the day there's always something , it isn't feeling the same like how i had felt my entire life .

On a positive note , good thing is i don't have any suicidal thoughts ."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of emotional distress and a change in outlook on life. The poster describes feeling indifferent and disengaged from social interactions and expresses a lack of joy or fulfillment in their daily experiences. They also mention feeling indifferent towards talking to people and feeling different from how they used to feel. These are all signs of a potential depressive episode. However, it is worth noting that they mention not having any suicidal thoughts, which is a positive point. Overall, the post exhibits enough indicators of emotional distress and a shift in mood and outlook to suggest that the poster may be suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""New friends Hi, I’m new here. I have a huge problem. It’s extremely hard for me to trust people I have a bond with (friends). Out of fear of rejection or disapproval for my actions, I don’t dare to become closer. I fear people will leave me eventually, so the idea that I have friends, isn’t present. When it is present, I feel like I need to stay in touch very often. I feel reluctant to take initiative often. If I don’t get asked for something, it’s a strong sign I’m not wanted. This has become standardized. I have some vague friends, but they live far away. We can’t that close, don’t share many interests, but we like each other. We can’t meet up often. What can I do to find new friends and do regularly something in my neighborhood. I’m close to a city, but I live in a village. I’m all day home (except for school and such), don’t feel energized to take action. Sigh. Getting advice like ‘find a sport, hobby, club’ doesn’t help much, I get suck. I feel like I don’t have even insight in the process of making friends. Or I’m not wanted. I feel like something is going wrong every time, but I don’t know what. Thanks in advance."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does exhibit some emotional indicators that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, but they are not as severe as those seen in very severe depression. The poster expresses a fear of rejection and disapproval, a lack of trust in forming close bonds with people, and a belief that they are not wanted by others. These feelings can be indicative of underlying depressive tendencies or social anxiety. Additionally, the poster mentions feeling reluctant to take initiative and lacking energy to take action, which could be signs of low motivation or lack of interest often associated with depression. However, the overall tone of the post is not as despairing or hopeless as seen in more severe cases of depression. The poster is seeking advice and help in finding new friends and becoming more active in their community, indicating a desire for change and improvement in their social situation. While the post does exhibit some emotional distress, it does not reach the level of severity seen in very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""extreme sadness whenever seeing anything happy Hello, this has been bothering me for a while and i have no idea what is this but when i ever i read or see anything happy like a happy scene or a happy story from some random comment i feel a huge wave of sadness wash over me and i feel like crying, why? what is going on? (i am not sure if this belongs to here but if not i don't mind it being deleted and sorry for breaking rules.)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a feeling of extreme sadness and a significant emotional reaction to anything happy. The poster describes experiencing a wave of sadness and feeling like crying when encountering positive or happy content. This intense emotional response to happiness is not typical and may indicate a symptom of depression called anhedonia, which is the inability to feel pleasure or joy. This emotional state aligns with the symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly anhedonia and heightened sensitivity to positive stimuli, suggesting that the poster may be suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""Is it normal that my parents won't let me travel alone? Hello, everyone!! I live in Portugal and my favorite band isn't playing in my country so I decided I wanted to see them in Madrid or Paris... I'm still deciding which country to pick. Is it normal that my parents won't let me travel alone? I'm 20 years old and they are paying for my college bills, but I would totally pay this trip. They are saying that it is very dangerous for a girl to go alone and that I don't understand because I don't have kids. Do you think this is a normal behavior by my parents? They scream at me and say that don't let me go like they own me... :/"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays strong emotional indicators of distress and frustration. The poster expresses a desire to travel and see their favorite band, but their parents are preventing them from doing so. They mention feeling controlled and owned by their parents, indicating a lack of autonomy and a sense of powerlessness. The mention of their parents screaming at them suggests a hostile and unhealthy dynamic, which can contribute to feelings of emotional distress. Overall, the post highlights a significant level of emotional distress and the lack of control over one's own choices, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I don't act depressed so people just think I'm edgy™ I'm pretty good at keeping up appearances in public but I do make the occasional depression joke, so when I tell those jokes or share a meme about suicide people think I'm making light of depression or laughing at suicidal people.

But then again you can't really reach out to anyone without being that ""depressing friend"" and the college therapist is pretty shit so here I ammmmmmmm"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post reveals important emotional indicators that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster mentions that they don't act depressed in public, implying that they are able to mask their true feelings and put on a positive facade. However, they use humor and make depression jokes as a way to indirectly express their true emotions. The mention of wanting to kill themselves on a daily basis is a significant red flag and a clear sign of emotional distress. The statement about not being able to reach out to anyone without being labeled the ""depressing friend"" suggests a lack of support system, which can also contribute to feelings of isolation and hopelessness. The mention of the college therapist being inadequate indicates a dissatisfaction with the available mental health resources. Overall, the post reveals a deep sense of despair, loneliness, and a lack of adequate mental health support, indicating a high likelihood of depression."
"Consider this post: ""Would you still be friends? Are we unreasonable? Hello dear people of Reddit I have a small major problem in my little group of friends. My problem is rather selfish but I feel betrayed and I don't know if she is still our friend. So let's start all over. There are 5 people involved BF (My Boyfriend) Snorly (My female friend and the 'victim') Berta (My other female friend that gave me the feel of beeing betrayed) Root (Because of him kinda started everything) And my humble self. So it all begun wenn Root sexually assaulted Snorly, she was at his home, learning with him and afterwards they watched something together, she started to feel tired and was half asleep. He touched her during that period she was shocked and pretended to wake up, when he noticed he pretended to be also asleep. She told him at the beginning, we all go together to school, that she had a Boyfriend and that she doesn't want any romantic relationshio with him. He didn't stop. At a slumber party we all were together, he touched her again, and suddendly lied directly next to her. She still hadn't told us any of this. Then came the point where he told someone some really private storys of us, which we told him in secret. We ignored him for a while but gave him a 2 chance. He messed up, again. My friends had to go to a further education, I wasn't with them because I work in another company, but well there he was awfull to BF when someone asked him why their team was so slow he answered because of 'BF'. This was the limit. We wanted to have nothing to do with him anymore. Snorly told us sometimes earlier what he had done to her. He told her to not tell anyone. But she told us that anyway and his boss. Now he gives her the fault, that everyone hates him. Just to mention, Root has depressions, and has already attempted suicide. So there are also moral and ethical views on everything. We don't bully him or anything like that, we ignore him. Well, Berta still hangs out with him, she even ditches us to eat lunch with him. And no she doesn't have any romantic intrest in him but in one of his best friends. We expected her to side with us. It is selfish but I can not forgive Root for what he has done, when doesn't even apologized for his actions or stands justice. Berta doesn't care. She laughs with him, she hangs out with him af if he has never hurt us. And this, this feels like betrayl. How do you see it guys? Are we wrong? Are we to harsh? Would you want to be still befriended with a person who sides with another person who hurt you? Or are we unreasonable? Tl:Dr My friend sexually assaulted another friend multiple times and was a mayor dick to us but our other friend still hangs out with him, would you still be friends with that person? Dick has depression and has attemptet suicide."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits emotional distress and betrayal, which could be indicative of depression. The poster describes feeling betrayed and hurt by a friend's actions, indicating a deep emotional impact from the situation. The mention of the perpetrator's depression and suicide attempts adds another layer of emotional complexity to the situation. The overall tone conveys a sense of despair, questioning if their feelings are justified and seeking validation for their emotions. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, particularly when compounded by the impact of traumatic events such as sexual assault."
"Consider this post: ""How do I get over a friendship? Hi all, I have gotten over people in the past... but having trouble here. The problem is that they treat all their other friends so good - but not me. So, it just hurts even more to get over this (I am the one ending the friendship because of how they treat me). I think I could get over it, if they were just a jerk or a bad friend - but they're not. They're just a bad friend to me. Any advice would be so helpful just to read and know maybe I'm not alone with the kind of pain."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays feelings of hurt and frustration over a troubled friendship, but does not demonstrate characteristics commonly associated with depression. The poster describes difficulty in getting over the friendship due to the differential treatment they receive compared to the friend's treatment of others. While there is emotional pain involved, the focus is on the specific issue of the friendship rather than a more generalized sense of despair or hopelessness. The tone of the post suggests a desire for advice and support rather than a profound emotional distress often found in severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Cold turkey of Escitalopram So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist. So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis. So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime. So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work. So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all. I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon. Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive. Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it. Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what's happening. **tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish. Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future? QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post presents a detailed account of the poster's experience with depression, including their initial diagnosis, medication regimen, and decision to abruptly stop taking the antidepressant escitalopram (""cold turkey""). The poster acknowledges that cold turkey is a terrible idea and should only be done under the guidance of a psychiatrist, indicating a level of awareness about their actions.

The tone of the post is marked by feelings of uncertainty, pessimism, and a lingering sense of lethargy. The poster expresses doubt about their decision to stop the medication and wonders why they have not experienced any significant withdrawal or adverse effects. This suggests that they are seeking validation or reassurance that their experience is normal or safe.

Additionally, the poster mentions being diagnosed with Lyme's Disease, which has symptoms that overlap with depression and ADHD-like disorders. This further complicates their understanding of their own condition and the necessity of medication.

Overall, the post reflects a level of self-reflection, concern, and seeking of advice that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster's hesitation, doubts, and willingness to share personal details about their history and current state indicate emotional distress and a desire for support or guidance."
"Consider this post: ""Brother owes Mother money, lives with her and isn't paying rent. Advice please? Not really sure which sub is the best place for this, so I've cross-posted in r/family, r/legaladviceuk and r/advice. Please let me know if any of them are inappropriate or if there are better subs for this. Thanks! The back story to this is long and possibly convoluted, but the tl;dr is my brother has had financial troubles for many years. In 2012, after the death of our grandmother, our mother paid off a large sum of my brothers' debts. He then paid some of this back with his own inheritance from the same. As a result of various relationship and/or financial cock-ups he has then loaned various further sums from our mother but with almost no repayments. He then ends up in a position to either bail out back to our mothers or lose employment and go wherever it is you go when you have no home or job. To be frank, we (myself, my partner and my mother) are at a loss as to what to do next. We think that perhaps we only have one realistic option (to kick my brother out and cut our losses) but this is something we would rather avoid. So we're asking Reddit for advice. So to (try yet fail to) cut a long story short... My brother moved back in with my mother in early December 2017 due to the breakup of a relationship. When he did so, he agreed (verbally) to both pay a very reasonable rate of rent and payments towards previous debts owed toward our mother (both monthly). He was given December as a 'payment holiday' of sorts. Two weeks later my brother took out a loan to replace his car as he needed transport to and from work. His previous vehicle was written off toward the end of his previous relationship and he did not replace it with the money gained from the resultant insurance claim. Due to poor credit history, our mother was guarantor for this loan. Due to concerns regarding my brothers previous unreliability with regards to money my mother decided to make a written and witnessed agreement with my brother regarding rent, the loan, and payment of previous debts. However, we are all collectively broke (not as broke as my brother) and so paid legal advice was out of the question. After some research I drafted a basic agreement, it was signed and witnessed by my mother, brother, partner and myself. In hindsight I should probably have used a solicitor for this but it is what it is. Fast-forward to 05/02/2018 and no payments have been received for anything. My mother received both an email and text alert for late payment on the loan that she is guarantor of on 31/01/18 but no other correspondence. She has not contacted the loan company but has received no further correspondence so believes my brother has paid this instalment at least. My mother also received a phone call from the garage that my brother bought he new car from, for which he loaned the entirety of the cost as the majority of the loan my mother is guarantor. He still owes them money. In short, besides kicking him out of my mothers house and saying goodbye to both my brothers previous debts (and therefore a large amount of my mothers money) and also resigning my mother to paying for the loan he took out in December, what can we do? Does the written agreement we made mean anything legally? What can I do to help my mother claim the money she lent previously? Or are these things lost causes? Any and all help is much appreciated. We just don't know what to do, but don't want to see my brother completely on his arse (unless I've put him on it...). TL;DR My brother owes my mother a significant amount of money, lives with her, she is guarantor for one of his loans, he has not paid his agreed rent etc. and we know he owes others money. What do we do now? Can kick him out, don't want to, seems likely may have to soon. Cannot live with or afford this. Edit: We are in the UK"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

While the post does discuss a stressful and potentially challenging situation involving financial troubles and family dynamics, it does not prominently display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression.

They mention losing a significant amount of weight, which is often seen as an achievement, but they still do not feel attractive or desirable. The mention of being forgotten by guys and feeling used by others because of the attractiveness of their siblings suggests a sense of unworthiness and a belief that their appearance determines their value.

But sometimes you just need a female friend to talk to, I am feeling quite lonely. So my question comes, how do you meet new people and make new friends at 30? You can't exactly ask someone to play like in the schoolyard in kindergarten - that takes on a whole new meaning these days."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a sense of loneliness and a desire to make new friends. The poster describes feeling friendless in their city and expresses a need for a female friend to talk to.

I think I'm nice, genuine, smart and funny and have been told by others that I'm very attractive. What's always bothered me though is not quite knowing why people think I'm weird. I think this information could be useful for first impressions like dates or interviews so I know how to temper this a little. At least initially. The only thing I can think of is that I love horror movies. In general, my interests seem pretty average otherwise (shopping, reading, traveling, etc). So, what makes someone weird?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. The poster discusses being labeled as ""weird"" by others but does not express significant emotional distress or feelings of hopelessness.

"Consider this post: ""Letter To Dad - Christian Fatherhood Author Kent Nerburn once wrote, “It is much easier to become a father than to be one.” This rings true, even for those men who really want to be a father. With enough hard work and determination we can master a career, a hobby, or a sport but it is difficult to even control anything in fatherhood, let alone master it.

Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked “Are you a serial killer?” That’s when my heart sank. I had just shaved and I realize I’m not the best looking guy in the world, but I didn’t know that’s how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home. I don’t know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit. I’m trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I’m just shocked that someone could say that.

"Consider this post: ""Ending a 6 year friendship over her husband I [24F] am not sure how I feel about my friend’s behavior [28F] and I’m considering ending our friendship because of it. A little backstory, I’ve known her almost 7 years. We met through our boyfriends (they’re our exes now) and we used to do double dates and a lot of couple-y activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that. She and I stayed friends despite the break-ups with our boyfriends at the time. But our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule. She usually works 40-60 hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for 18 months so I didn’t always get to see her or hang out as much as I would have liked. But we’ve kept in touch through social media. I’ve always expressed a desire to hang out more, like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but she’s either too busy or financially strapped to do it. So typically we either see each other on our birthdays and that’s about it. The problem I’m having is that she’s married to this guy she met 4 years ago and I’ve been single for 5 years. I have a FWB [25M] who I’ve been in a “situationship” with for 18 months. I kept that a secret from her because it’s not a real relationship and I’m not sure if it’ll ever become one. She’s met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and I were out at a store. Ever since she became aware of his existence, she’s been pressuring me to plan “double dates” like going to the drive-ins to see the new Star Wars Movie or coming over to their house for Redbox movies and dinner. I already told her that’s not really the type of relationship that I have. I’ve mentioned the idea of all 4 of us hanging out to him casually to see if he’d be interested but he doesn’t want to do it. When I told her that I rather she and I just go to the movies together or girls’ night over at my place, she said she can’t because she wants to spend time with her husband when she’s not busy working. I feel like she’s not really going to spend time with me unless I give in and do “couples” activities. I just feel like she and I are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it'd be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who doesn't seem to want to do things just the two of us. Is it wrong of me not to want to be friends because of this?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with the friendship, particularly due to the friend's busy schedule and lack of availability for activities. The mention of the friend pressuring the poster to engage in ""double dates"" and couples activities despite the poster's discomfort and different type of relationship indicates a lack of understanding and compatibility in values. While the post does convey some negative emotions, such as feeling like they are in different places in life and questioning the future of the friendship, it does not exhibit the profound emotional distress typically associated with very severe depression.

Hello to anyone out there, I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically.

I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me. Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock. I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim. I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it. If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I'm hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest. I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I'm lonely, i'm always sad and i'm just a piece of shit that is worthless. Good Bye everyone. I hope you've all had an awesome day.

"Consider this post: ""I thought I'd share two quotes that I liked/felt I could relate to. I don't know why I feel like sharing them here, but maybe somebody can take something away from them.

The second goes as ""What do you do from morning to night? I endure myself."""" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post includes quotes that convey a sense of despair, nihilism, and existential suffering.

Shifts are 8hrs long and I'm making minimum wage. Most people would like to have my job it's relatively simple and easy but I feel like shit every time I come home from a shift. Society ""requires"" us as citizens to go to work pretty much every day to pay for living expenses and food.

"Consider this post: ""Anyone else hate talking about depression specifically because all the attempts at help feel fake? Guess it’s stupid posting this, all things considered, but I’m a moron anyway and besides that I’m also looking just to see if I’m alone in thinking this. Like at this point I’d rather just hear comments from people who are also feeling down. “Help” from others makes me fucking angry at them, especially strangers, because it doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t make me feel better to be told “things will get better!”, it doesn’t help to be told I’m loved, and in the event people bring up stuff like “you’ll never get to have a family” (yes this does happen as though that matters) it makes me want to actually hurt them in real life. I don’t and can’t, but holy shit. I don’t even like when friends try to make me feel better anymore because it feels like they don’t even get the point. What sucks though is trying to get over that primal instinct to not kill myself. I don’t particularly want to live and I really don’t want to live past ~40, but my dumb animal brain just thinks “owie death and pain bad” and won’t let me do it. I’m kinda hoping that maybe instead I can get into an accident or just get really ill."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post contains multiple indicators of very severe depression. The poster expresses a strong disdain for discussing depression, feeling that all attempts at help are fake. They refer to themselves as a moron and express a desire to hear from others who are also feeling down. The tone of the post is filled with anger and frustration towards those who offer help or try to make them feel better. The mention of wanting to hurt others in response to certain comments suggests a significant level of distress and potential for self-harm or harm to others. The poster also mentions not wanting to live past a certain age and expresses a hope for accidental death or illness, indicating suicidal ideation. These statements and emotions align with the symptoms commonly associated with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""How to deal with indecisive parents? My parents are unbelievably indecisive. They make every single day about making a big decision about who moves to which country and it’s horrible. I’ve lived in New Zealand for almost ten years now, and three years ago my dad moved back to the UK for work. Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live? When I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing. I was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christ’s sake. They got me worked up like this for a good three months before telling me it’s not going to happen after all. I mean it would have been fine if they had not got the idea in my head. I can not take it any more. It is mentally exhausting and I have spent the past 6-7 years feeling powerless and anxious. Does anyone else have such indecisive parents? And if so how do you deal with the 24 hour stress that you find yourself in? Sorry for the long post!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a sense of frustration, confusion, and anxiety regarding the indecisiveness of the poster's parents.

The focus of the post is primarily seeking advice and experiences from others who may have dealt with similar situations, rather than expressing overwhelming emotional pain."
"Consider this post: ""I find myself hating birthdays and Christmas now Those are the times when you’re surrounded by friends and feel loved. I don’t get that so I find myself starting to hate it. And I feel bad about feeling this way? I feel bad that I’m the one who can’t seem to smile and laugh when everyone else around me can do it just fine. I feel bad that I’m the one at school that’s known for never smiling. That must be why no one tries to talk to me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong sense of negative emotions, self-disdain, and a feeling of isolation. The poster expresses a growing dislike for birthdays and Christmas because they feel disconnected from the joy and love that others seem to experience during these times. They also express guilt and shame for not being able to appear happy or engage socially, believing it to be the reason for their lack of meaningful connections. This combination of negative emotions, self-blame, and social isolation aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Does anyone else feel like life is maybe too long? I don't know what it is, but just having to face so many days of the same things, even if you switch it up once in a while, it's all so boring and monotonous.

Just a thought I've been having. Have a good night."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

"Consider this post: ""Get myself to be more active/alive? So, my depression is getting worse and worse since a few years. I'm in law school and I'm in the last year of preparation - in our country, this is THE BUSIEST TIME ever for those students - like, they start studying at 7 in the morning at stay until 11 in the night at the library. nonstop studying for 1-1,5 years in preparation for the big exams. I started last october. it's july. I have maybe studied on two or three days, seriously. the other time, I just sit at home, in a kind of weird freeze. I'm BORED out of my mind, my brain is longing for some activity, and I actually really want to be all busy and studying and feel like I have a purpose. It's like I know exactly how important it is now, and my brain is screaming at me to get my books out and start doing what I want to do. But I just sit here. Heck, if I'm procrastinating so bad, at least I could have fun, party, travel, meet people, see the world, at least not waste my time or waste it in a way that's at least fun! But I'm still sitting here. Like in a shock. It feels like it's too late for the studying thing (exams are in spring and I have no idea about the subjects and skip all classes I'm paying for) and I have no idea what else to do with my time. It doesn't help that over the last two years, I kinda developed an eating disorder with anorexic, bulimic and binge-eating-tendencies that also made my health decline. I'm constantly thinking about numbers, looking up nutritional infos, reading medical studies, looking at food online - it's taking so much space in my head although I'm quite 'close to my goal', and I shouldn't even worry because if I keep doing what I planned (restrict for another 4-5 weeks, then slowly up my calories until I no longer lose weight, stay at maintenance and start to slowly incorporate exercise to finally be healthy, eating healthy, and exercising to maintain good health), there's no reason to be so occupied with this topic. Any idea how to get myself to get up and DO SOMETHING? The sitting around is what is probably making me most depressed, because I watch my life burn down and kind of can't do anything about. PLEASE don't suggest to get professional help. I know, it's the most rational thing, especially for the eating thing, but right now, I just can't, I really can't :("" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of hopelessness and despair, along with symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster describes their depression getting worse over the past few years and expresses a lack of motivation and inability to engage in activities, including their law school studies. They also mention feeling bored and wanting to have a purpose, but being unable to find the motivation to do anything. The mention of developing an eating disorder and the preoccupation with food and numbers indicates a decline in their mental and physical health.

"Consider this post: ""On the Verge of a Mental collapse Hello everyone. I hope we all make it out of depression. I just want to post my feelings at this moment. It feels as though I'm on the verge of a breakdown. My life is in a very sad place. My parents are trying to keep upbeat and are hoping for the best. They know of my anxiety and depression. My mom drove me today and I didn't talk at all because I was in one of those moods I get in. I love my Mother a lot and she is very dear to me. I want to get out of this and become someone, but it is very hard. Anxiety has suffocated me and I'm afraid to go out in public due to feeling awkward and confidence issues. I have been crying a lot because I have lost hope in myself. When I look at pictures of myself or my family happy, I get emotional. The years are flying by me and I have no way to catch them. I see everyone around me getting older and I'm getting extremely saddened by it. My anxiety prevents me from going out in public and I waste away my days. My life is a mess right now.Thank you to all who read this and I hope the best for you all."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression.

I gave her my box cutter on Friday and today I started looking for something else in my room and I don’t have anything. I’m going to my schools counseling center with her today."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates a strong desire to engage in self-harming behavior but expresses a conflict between that desire and a promise made to the poster's girlfriend. The mention of looking for something else in the room suggests a persistent urge to self-harm. The decision to go to the school's counseling center with the girlfriend can be seen as a proactive step towards seeking help, but the overall tone of the post conveys a deep emotional distress and struggle. The post displays a high level of emotional pain, self-destructive thoughts, and a lack of healthy coping mechanisms, which are often symptoms associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Just a rant So today my parents came from NY to pick up the kids from me as I will be leaving the country for 6ish months soon. My soon to be ex wife leaves to move back to Japan tomorrow. This girl I started to hang out with and we both seem into each other but she has reservations about anything serious bc we work together just informed me that she is pretty much busy until I leave the country....which does coincide with one of her best friends moving as well...awful timing I know. I just feel so alone...my kids are gone...my marriage is done (im actually happy about this after months of depression)...and the person who i had started to grow closer too said we cant really hangout (probably) before I leave :/. Sorry i know others have more bigger problems but these are mine."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of loneliness, sadness, and disappointment. The poster discusses their soon to be ex-wife leaving, their children being gone, and the person they were starting to grow closer to being busy. These events contribute to a sense of feeling alone and abandoned.

"Consider this post: ""The pharmacist always starts treating me like I’m fragile and could crack any minute as soon as she sees my prescription is for bupropion. I am fragile of course, but it kills me to see that visible switch from “general customer service friendly” to “you poor thing, let me treat you like the sad and fragile creature you are”. They all mean well, and it’s nice to see that they take it seriously, but I just want to be treated like I’m more than my depression. I won’t hurt myself because you didn’t call me a sweet name like honey and change the tone of your voice to one you would use worth a small child who’s upset. I know you see the dead look in my eyes and wonder if my meds aren’t strong enough or if you need to remind me yet again that I need to watch for increased thoughts of suicide. I feel better than I have in a long time, but I’m not there yet and I’m still struggling to address the root of my depression, so yeah I still look awful."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of emotional vulnerability and frustration with how the poster is treated by the pharmacist. The poster describes feeling fragile and being treated as if they are always on the brink of cracking. They express a desire to be seen as more than their depression and to be treated with normality and respect. The mention of the ""dead look"" in their eyes and struggling to address the root of their depression suggests ongoing emotional distress.

"Consider this post: ""It's been almost 7 years.. 7 years.. Holy shit.. It'll be 7 years in May.. It still feels like yesterday when I got that call from your dad, telling me what happened. And I remember dropping everything I was doing at work, and rushing to the hospital. Slowly walking into the room, with your family gathered around you, that's when it hit me, and I broke down.. I lost it.. Couldn't control myself, and I couldn't stop crying. When I had to say goodbye, it broke my fucking heart.. Losing my best friend, my fiancé, was the hardest day of my life. But every year after, the pain slowly faded away, and it didn't haunt me anymore. But last week, when your dad called me and said that he'd be in town for work, and wanted to get together, it made my day. Hadn't seen/heard from him in about 6 months. But last night, when your sister called, and told me that your dad passed away in his sleep from a heart attack, it was like the whole world had stopped spinning again.. Fuck, it's been a long weekend. And damnit, it's gonna be a long week.. P.S. Mr Rhodes, give Elaina a hug for me, and tell her I miss her, and that I'm doing alright.

"Consider this post: ""26 thinking of moving family upset Okay so this past 5 months have been overwhelming. I’ve had a lot of major things happen. I got married in October and over the past year I’ve been connecting with my father and half brothers (who I just consider brotthers) and that whole side off the family. My dads never been apart of my life. I saw him probably about 4 times out of my 26 years on earth. The last time until this past week I saw my dad was when I was 10 so 16 years ago. That was also the last time I ever flew on a plane. I decided to fly down about two weeks ago for a week and I had such a good time connecting with my brothers and my oldest brothers wife and my nephew and grandparents and everyone! I loved the idea of everyone together closely and always at each others houses and I got along so well with my brothers and it was really nice. My brother and sister in law decide to that they’re going to move back to Florida where my dad and dads family is and they all really want me to move there. They love the idea of us getting close as a family and setting traditions and spending holidays together. Honestly I love that idea. My problem is my mother raised me, she’s always been there for me. She has nobody other than me. She doesn’t even have a car I drive her places. My grandmother who is also soo important to me she’s my second mother she’s been in a nursing home for 10 years and she’s confused a lot but still not that confused. The thought of leaving them makes me want to cry and I feel like I couldn’t. My mom would feel so betrayed and angry at me. She’s already feeling a little hurt because I’m getting closer with my dad that family. Which is wrong but she has a lot of issues of her own. The thought of leaving my grandma I could never. :( I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never left NY my husband also has his father here and his father would hate me if I brought “his son” away. My husband acts like he dose not care but ofcose he must. I just don’t know what to do I feel so stuck like if I even considered moving I’d feel so selfish and horrible. I couldn’t leave my mom and I feel like she wouldn’t come with me she’d be so angry that I was “choosing my father who did nothing for me and his family who ignored me” over staying near her. Idk this is probably all too soon also but I just want to form good relationships with my brothers and nephew and soon to be niece. And my dad. I don’t want my life to pass away and miss it all. Ever since I came back from visiting them for a week my mom has been giving me such a guilt trip about spending my money to go visit them or how she feels used and it’s crazy to me. Idk what to do But this is for sure a rant. Thanks for listening forever did."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a mixed range of emotions and concerns, primarily centered around the dilemma of moving to be closer to the poster's newly connected family versus staying near their mother and grandmother who have been important figures in their life. While there are feelings of guilt, confusion, and being stuck, the overall tone of the post does not exhibit the profound hopelessness, despair, and self-esteem issues commonly associated with very severe depression. The emotions expressed are more related to a difficult decision and the fear of upsetting loved ones, rather than a deeply pervasive emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""I don't know how I'm gonna do it. I'm 27. I lived alone, had my own stuff, my own life. I gave up everything to join the military. I went to live with my parents again until I left for boot camp. I went to boot camp. I got hurt and it stopped my training. I was heartbroken. I had to come home and move back in with my parents because I had nothing to my name. Now, I'm stuck with them for at least the next 3 months. I've been back from boot camp since late September. They want me to show them my bank account once a week. They have an amount of my own money that I earn that I can spend every week. I want to leave, but my credit is crap and it won't allow me to get my own place just yet as most places do a credit check. I'm getting my own car here shortly. I recently had a really bad breakup with a woman who I had spent almost 3 years of my life with. I'm heartbroken and absolutely lost. She was my world. She told me I was her world. She has found someone else and now claims that most of what we had was fake and now she wants nothing to do with me. I can't find any reason to continue with life. I don't have any control over my own life. My folks don't want rent, but they control every aspect of the rest of my life instead and every time I walk in the house, I can feel the tension and I get talked to like a child whenever I don't follow their rules. The woman I had committed my life to now practically hates me. I see no way out. I just want it all to end. Please let it end."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a profound sense of despair, hopelessness, and emotional pain. The poster discusses sacrificing their independence and giving up everything for the military, only to be halted by an injury and forced to move back in with their parents.

"Consider this post: ""I think I ruined another friendship TL;DR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I've done a million time before. I've had depression my whole life and I've always gone through episodes. Sometimes they're mild, and I'm just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I've also never had a lot of friends. I don't have casual relationships. I either don't really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There's no middle ground. I've been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It doesn't seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I'd opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it. The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wasn't severe, but it made me fragile. I'm a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I'd just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship. I texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I'd like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wasn't crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it. Wednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and didn't come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I've been a shitty friend and I'm sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop. Friday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply ""yes"". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing. I talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I'd love to see her and then I didn't contact her again until yesterday at work. Yesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President's day weekend, but she had a surgery and she didn't want to plan anything until it was done (that's a whole other thing that's bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President's day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so ""we'll see"". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she's been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I've lost my gym buddy. I've had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I'm not depressed, I'm funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I've had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out. Amy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she didn't"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several key indicators of depression. The poster describes a history of depression and experiencing episodes of varying severity. They express a pattern of self-destructive behavior and feeling as though they have ruined friendships in the past by forcing their problems on others. This demonstrates low self-esteem and a lack of belief in their own worthiness of maintaining relationships. The post also reveals a fear of abandonment, as they worry that their actions may have caused their current friend to distance herself. The mention of losing their gym buddy and feeling hurt by it emphasizes their reliance on external sources of support and highlights a potential lack of self-motivation or enjoyment in activities. The overall tone of the post is one of sadness, self-blame, and desperation for validation and understanding, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""The moment of clarity I've had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem. Throughout my entire lifetime, my thoughts have been so warped that I just assumed that they are normal parts of the human experience. It sounds so stupid typing things out. The moment I realized that my mental illness was ""real"" was coming to the conclusion that well-adjusted people do not think about killing themselves on a regular basis. And with that, came my wake up call to get help.."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has had suicidal ideations for a long time and has dismissed their depression as not being a problem. This suggests a long-standing struggle with mental health. The realization that these thoughts are not normal and the decision to seek help indicate a significant turning point and a recognition of the severity of their mental illness. The mention of warped thoughts and the feeling of typing something stupid further suggests a negative self-perception and possibly low self-esteem, which are common symptoms of depression. Overall, the post conveys a deep emotional pain, a realization of the seriousness of their mental health issues, and a willingness to seek help, all of which align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""[Need Advice] best friend (21f) moving in with my dad (dad age) and I (21f) My best friend and I have talked about living together plenty of times. Now it’s really happening because her family is moving out of state and she has nowhere to go. My dad and I live in an apartment together and share expenses (though he pays for most of it). It’s a pretty good situation, but there are anxieties we both have about my friend moving in. She is unemployed and has been for a while. The deal was that she could move in once she got a job (the deal was made like 7 months ago), but she is still jobless and her family is leaving in 3 days. We’re letting her move in, and luckily her mom is willing to help out with her expenses until she gets a job. But here are the worries: • She had a lot of time before this to get a job, what if she takes even more time even after she’s moved in? My dad and I know from experience how difficult getting a job can be, but also expected her to have one by now. The thing is, she’s very picky (even when she can’t afford to be). She won’t just take any job, she’s only applying to places she’d prefer to work at. Which I totally get! But at some point you just gotta do something even if you hate it, it won’t last forever and will even help you get to doing something you don’t hate. She’s repeatedly said that she’s “not the kind of person that can work a job she doesn’t like”. And that is definitely making it take longer for her to find work. But what can ya do? • Another thing is, my dad and I (my dad especially) have had not-so-great experiences with friends/acquaintances moving in. That’s definitely made both of us have some not-so-great feelings about this situation (even if it may end up being really good!). A lot of things can ruin this and it’s hard to know how to avoid those things while still being a friend. It’s a thin thin line. • my dad and I (my dad more than me) are also worried about compatibility. My dad and I get along great and it’s been no problem for us to live together. We have an unspoken agreement on bills, chores, privacy, etc. It just works. How can we keep that agreement while including a whole new person who might not think the same way? For instance, I don’t know much about the way she lives. I know how it’s been with her family, but things are different when you leave home. It’s tough to say how it will be, but my dad is worried that she won’t be the kind of clean, kind, generous person he expects a friend/roomie to be. It’s tough because I agree with him.. • there’s the other matter of an official Roommate Agreement that could be made and signed by the 3 of us. We all think it’s a great idea, but I know how things can still get messy (literally and figuratively) when living with a friend. The problems that can arise are endless and maybe some even unavoidable. All we want is for things to work out well, with the least amount of issues as possible. Communication is key and that’s the goal of this Roommate Agreement. However, there is still that line that we do not want to cross. I want this move-in to be professional as well as friendly. How can my dad and I make the rules clear so that she will take them very seriously without this being like some kind of crazy contract? Thanks for even reading this!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The main focus is on concerns and worries about the upcoming living situation with the best friend moving in. While there may be some underlying anxieties and uncertainties, the tone of the post seems more practical and seeking advice rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. The poster discusses specific concerns about their friend's joblessness and job preferences, compatibility with their dad, and the challenges of creating a roommate agreement. These concerns are more related to practical considerations rather than signs of depression."
"Consider this post: ""My plans for valentines day: 1. Lay in my bed. 2. Feel lonely. 3. Try to cry. 4. Realize I will never cry again. 5. Hate myself. 6. Debate if I should tell someone how shit I feel. 7. Lay there for the rest of the day."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of loneliness, despair, and self-hatred. The poster describes their plans for Valentine's Day, which involve staying in bed, feeling lonely, and attempting to cry. They express a belief that they will never be able to cry again, which could indicate anhedonia, a common symptom of depression. Additionally, the mention of debating whether to tell someone how they feel suggests a struggle with reaching out for support. The overall tone of the post is filled with hopelessness and a lack of self-worth, indicating a significant level of emotional distress that aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Little sister has depression, what do I do? As the title says my baby sister has depression and I heard from my boyfriend this subreddit gives him support. I just discover the past summer that my little sister (14) has depression and is now cutting her self with razor blades. I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well. She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, isn’t a psychologist. My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think? Change her of school and remove her from the toxic environment or leave her there and get her a psychologist?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses concern for the poster's younger sister who is struggling with depression and engaging in self-harm. The mention of discovering the sister's diary and learning about her calorie counting behavior suggests a deep level of involvement and concern for her well-being. The poster also mentions that the sister's circle of friends also have depression and one of them is self-harming. The overall tone of the post conveys a sense of helplessness and uncertainty, as the poster and their mother are unsure about the right course of action to help the sister. The mention of considering changing schools to remove her from a toxic environment highlights the severity of the situation and the need for intervention. The post demonstrates a clear and significant level of emotional distress, which aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Anhedonia.. anyone else experience it? I just want to vent and have some insight. I never ""fall"" in love anymore. I'm lucky if I can even feel love. My current boyfriend is so supportive, but as the past few years of my life, just can't fall in love. I don't feel the own love or care for my family or friends. I don't care if something happened to my friends, and I don't care if I never see my loving, caring parents again for a long time, or ever. I don't care to help friends or family with anything. I have no passions in life. I have no hobbies. I'm not passionate about my family, friends, work, school, boyfriend, hobbies, my Jeep, animals, etc.. NOTHING excites me, brings me happiness or joy or peace. OCD, anhedonia and depression control everything. The only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that's positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I don't believe in antidepressants for myself. I've been stressed out so much I've lost a bunch of weight too. Now that I've vented, I just don't want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about. I want to go to work and be happy and thankful I have a job that I do. I want to feel love for my mom and dad. Is anyone else like me out there? Does it ever get better?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post includes several indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes experiencing anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure or find joy in activities or relationships. They express a lack of love or care for family and friends, a lack of passion or excitement for anything in life, and a feeling of emptiness or numbness. The mention of OCD, anhedonia, and depression controlling their life suggests the presence of multiple mental health issues. The post also mentions worsening depression due to starting a new birth control medication and a significant amount of stress leading to weight loss. The overall tone is one of hopelessness, longing for change, and a desire to not feel alone in their experience. These symptoms align with very severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""Just wanted to let it out I wanna kill myself. I'm seriously depressed and I can't bring myself to trust in others and tell them. Maybe because I can leave myself the option if no one knows to stop me if I want to go. But for now, I guess I'll keep hiding it. It's nice to be able to say it though, even if no one on here sees it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post explicitly expresses thoughts of suicide, which is a major indicator of severe depression. The poster also mentions feeling seriously depressed and lacking trust in others, suggesting a deep emotional pain and isolation. The mention of keeping it hidden and the use of the phrase ""if I want to go"" further indicates the severity of the poster's despair and suggests a lack of hope or desire to seek help. This post exhibits characteristics commonly associated with severe depression."
"Consider this post: ""The only time I can enjoy my life is when I'm watching anime/listening to music Every time I put on those headphones that allow me to leave this miserable reality, I feel alive. Any other time I feel like I'm just lifelessly struggling to deal with my responsibilities. That's why I listen to music all the time. That's why I only get excited when watching anime. I need fiction to get me through a day or else I go completely numb. So uhh is this a problem? Or is it normal?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post conveys a strong reliance on anime and music as a means of escape and the only time when the poster feels alive and excited. This suggests a lack of enjoyment or fulfillment in other aspects of their life and a feeling of numbness or detachment from reality. The mention of struggling with responsibilities and the need for fiction to get through the day implies a significant level of emotional distress and reliance on external sources for emotional support. The tone of the post also indicates a sense of questioning whether this reliance on fiction is a problem or if it is considered normal, which could be indicative of underlying feelings of self-doubt or uncertainty about their emotional state. Overall, the post displays emotional indicators that align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I did it bois This time forreal lmfao. I'm happy, laughing and grinning for the first time, genuinely out of happiness and not memes/jokes for like over 9 months. It is kinda sad that I depend so much on other people, but I think my best friend cured my depression. Honestly got in an enlightening convo with him, I feel really really really great!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster has been experiencing depression for over 9 months. They express that they have finally experienced genuine happiness after a conversation with their best friend. This suggests that their recent emotional state is a departure from their usual depressed state. Additionally, the mention of depending on other people for happiness and the acknowledgement of their own sadness and reliance on others can be indicative of low self-esteem and potential underlying depressive symptoms. While the post does express some positive emotions, the overall context and references to past struggles suggest that the poster may still be dealing with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I'm not dead. I'm trying my best now to get a full recovery First off sorry to anyone in this sub who messaged me or was worried about what I posted before. I haven't even come on here besides to see the front page. I didn't hang myself although I was really close too. It would've been my third attempt and even though shit sucks right now I'm trying my best not to. Thank you for whoever attempted to talk me out of it, I read them all. Here's to all of us getting better and living our lives to the fullest"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post begins by acknowledging previous concerning behavior and apologizing for any worry caused. The poster mentions feeling close to hanging themselves and indicates that this would have been their third attempt. This demonstrates a significant level of emotional distress and potential suicidal ideation, which are clear indicators of severe depression. However, the post transitions to a more positive tone, expressing a commitment to getting better and living life to the fullest. This could indicate a mixture of emotions but still aligns with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Finally going to doctors Put off many appointments because of my anxiety. Wish me luck"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a sense of relief and accomplishment in finally going to the doctors, indicating that the poster has likely been struggling with their anxiety for some time. The mention of putting off appointments due to anxiety suggests that their anxiety has been significantly impacting their ability to seek help and take care of their health.

"Consider this post: ""How do I keep from being jealous of my very successful best friend? So, I've been die-hard friends with this girl for about 4 years. Our friendship has been through SO MUCH during that time: the death of her father, relationships and breakups, we've worked several jobs together and lived together. We jokingly call each other ""husband and wife""! She's an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She's getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house. I am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth. Recently, I've had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was ""cheating on me"". I think what I'm most jealous of is her freedom while I'm chained to a desk job all day. How do I address this so that I don't end up being resentful for her success! I feel like I'm being left behind. TL;DR I'm jealous of my successful friend and want to stop."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is experiencing feelings of jealousy towards their successful best friend. However, the tone of the post is not overwhelmingly negative or despairing. The poster expresses excitement and support for their friend's achievements and actively participates in her events and shows. While there are mentions of bad dreams and feelings of being left behind, it does not exhibit the deep sense of hopelessness, emotional distress, or lack of fulfillment that is commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone seems more reflective and seeking advice on how to address and overcome these feelings of jealousy and resentment."
"Consider this post: ""Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job. So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"". Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around. So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point. Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays several indicators of emotional distress and possible depression. The poster expresses feelings of being used, disrespected, and bitter towards their friend. They also mention feeling like a victim and questioning the worthiness of the friendship. These emotions, combined with the mention of feeling depressed and not knowing why, suggest a significant level of emotional distress and a potential correlation with depression."
"Consider this post: ""Frustrating Friend So my friend loves to catch up for coffee. Invites 10 or so of us to one session to catch up with as many of us as possible. I'm a SAHM with a nearly 3 year old and 8 weeks off giving birth to my second. I'm also dealing with my husband being in a new job so it's a new routine for our boy. It's also a 40 minute bus ride into the city each time, maybe longer sometimes coz our weather is crap most of the time (take note). My friend knows this but constantly badgers me to come for coffee whenever HE has free time. He just started a new job as of yesterday. Before this he had free time 24/7. I told him in a huge message how my circumstances make it hard to just head into the city when he asks and that I can manage it on days I have midwife appointments. He replied that he had just as much responsibilities that he had to deal with but he managed to still come into town to visit everyone. It feels like he just ignored what I was saying and that meeting him was more important. Soooo frustrated!! What do I do? Am I a crap friend or does he need to understand where I'm coming from better?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on a frustrating situation with a friend and seeking advice on how to handle it. While there may be some level of frustration and annoyance expressed, there is no indication of overwhelming emotional distress, hopelessness, or despair commonly associated with very severe depression. The post revolves around a specific interpersonal issue rather than broader emotional struggles."

While we aim to facilitate a fun and welcoming place for online strangers to meet and make friends, our core philosophy rests on the concept of free and open discussion. This means the staff takes a hands-off approach in regards to the opinions of the users and the language used. At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn’t the place for you. **What’s with the Theme?** Our server’s theme is a fun piece of window dressing that allows a colourful hierarchy of roles for users to work towards via their activity in the server. We may be a hole in the wall, but we are a classy one at that :p **General Life?** The server consists of text, media, and voice channels where users share their interests, pets, favourite videos, etc, and have discussions of all varieties. Most of the action happens in the voice channels however, where we have rooms for watching movies, listening to music, and playing video games in addition to large rooms for rowdy discussions and smaller rooms for more quiet conversations. Sometimes we’re all in a big room together, chilling out as we play video games, and other times we splinter off into separate rooms to partake in differing activities. Once a week however we host a planned movie event where users make suggestions, cast votes, and hold screenings of their favourite films. We would like to partake in more regular planned events as the server grows. **Bots!** Our main bot, Madam Luvaeux, incorporates a silly currency system so that you can gamble, purchase other users, and even buy colourful roles to lord over other users.

"Consider this post: ""My dad is getting older, in bad shape and is too stubborn to do anything about it I love my parents, but over the past 10 years my dad has been gaining weight and eating junk that has made him become pretty unhealthy. About 4 years ago, he suffered from a heart attack before I headed to work; he collapsed in front of my mom and I had to run out the door and knock on both my neighbors doors since they both new CPR. Luckily, the paramedics came in time and he was able to survive through surgery. He's on medication now and all of his tests have come through positive, but he is still overweight. He's 61 and I realize he's not getting any younger. My mother and I have been trying to get him to eat healthier and stop drinking so much, he drinks chardonnay every night and a lot of it a week. EVERY time we bring it up, he immediately diverts the topic to something else, and blames us for being negative and to be more ""positive"". He says he works too much and that we are just ganging up on him. Psychologically I believe he's just so stubborn that he won't ever admit to actually being unhealthy and doing something about it. He's tried to workout but he never makes much progress. I want my dad to live for as long as possible, but he's just so incredibly stubborn and toxic about it that eventually i'm afraid he's not going to last much longer, we are both incredibly frustrated.

"Consider this post: ""Are any of you on agomelatine? Currently on 30mg/mirtazapine a day, which is ok aside from how hungry and sleepy it makes me (I understand that they can be desirable effects for some people but not what I’m looking for). I read a bit about agomelatine and it appears not to have those side effects but I wanted to know how real people have experienced it before asking the doctor to prescribe it. Thanks"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates that the poster is currently taking mirtazapine but is experiencing unwanted side effects such as increased appetite and sleepiness. They express interest in trying agomelatine instead and are seeking real experiences from others before discussing it with their doctor. While there may be a slight hint of frustration with the side effects of their current medication, there is no strong indication of profound emotional distress or hopelessness.

"Consider this post: ""Horribly depressed lately. Hello, my name is Jay and just like the title says, I'm pretty depressed. Just... Ugh, nothing goes right these days. I've always had issues with depression, but the last two years have been especially hellish. I don't even know where to start, but I think the biggest problem is always being alone with my thoughts. I don't have any friends or people like that, and my hobbies don't even interest me enough anymore to keep my mind off it. I've thought about and tried to kill myself before, one attempt just a few days ago, but I can't even do that right.

"Consider this post: ""Any advice on how to handle leaving my only friend? LAST thing I need right now is the pain but I think I have to. I've posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok. I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however. For so long I've been completely alone and it really sucked. I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we've had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out. We've hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now. I feel like we have a real connection but she doesn't show it if she feels the same. I'm an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot. I certainly would be able to quit if I didn't have to drink to be around her. Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she's into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she's made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night. She's CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything. She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she's made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I've been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit. Everything is always about her, she's even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it's just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her. If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject. I know she's not really a ""friend"" more of a ""company prostitute"" if anything, it seems like I'm always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back. I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time. She actually ""ghosted"" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it. When we finally started hanging out again she didn't seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer ""why"" she'd block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue. I feel like she's getting worse and no matter how hard I try I can't help her or make her seem to care. I don't think I can handle the pain of losing my ""friend"" again. I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time.

How do I get over it and not let the grief consume me? Please help."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post displays a multitude of emotional indicators associated with very severe depression.

I forget appointments, I forget items at the store, I forget how to do things, anything that can be forgotten, I forget. I don’t mean to. There is some kind of block in my brain that’s screwing that up due to my many disorders. However, it’s being interpreted as apathy, especially by my parents—they’ve had enough of repeatedly reminding me to do things, and I’m an adult, and they need to concentrate on THEIR lives and what THEY need to do, particularly to help my thirteen-year-old sister blossom now. So this needs to stop. What can I do about this? Medications, cognitive therapy, anything else? I need to save my family ties and my future before they’re completely destroyed.""

"Consider this post: ""im lost without her but I don't know what to do So me and my best friend of about 7 years stopped talking and being friends essentially, around a year ago. We had been fighting a bit before and it kind of led up to this. So what kind of started it off was the fact she got a new boyfriend who was and I swear still is, the biggest jerk of all time. I can see now that it probably wasn't my place to tell her that but I was only looking out for her and she used to appreciate advice like that from me in the past. Then she started pretty much ditching me for him and taking his side and telling him things that were private and I felt like she was slowly kicking me out and replacing me. And I told her that, but she didn't see it because she had her new guy and it was kind of like she didn't care because she had someone there for her. She also lost a couple other friends before this happened pretty much due to the same reasons so I didn't feel that bad at first because I was kind of like you know ""she did this to herself, she made this choice"". But now, I really miss her and I hate that we stopped being friends because I kind of need her. Im not sure what to do. She did actually text me about a month after we stopped talking and was like ""hey, I know we don't talk anymore but I wanted to see how you are going"" and I actually ignored it because I was angry and didn't care but now I kind of see it was a bitch move. And I don't know how to text her or talk again because its awkward and she's still with this guy and I'm pretty sure he hates me and I juts don't know how to handle it. But I really want to make this right again. Any help would be really appreciated :)"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""How to deal with people who can't seem to be bothered with you? Question is fairly self-explanatory. I ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it's making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It's all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left. Even back when I'd hang out with them, they'd be on their phone talking to these other friends of theirs and I feel so hurt. Being alone sucks. No matter what, I can never seem to make friends with anyone new. The majority of other people my age are living it up, but I can't seem to do anything with anyone apart from my family. I feel like I'm missing out on something. I feel so unwanted to the point I've started deleting all my social media to isolate myself even more. It's beginning to eat away at me and my depression is coming back, as much as I hate to admit it. I do not know whether to take this opportunity to improve myself and pursue my own hobbies and basically just do things on my own, or attempt to reconnect with my friends/actively seek out people who will appreciate me. ANyone have any advice to get me out of this rut and to feel less shit about wasting my youth ? Words of wisdom? Previous similar experiences etc?""

I’m always holding onto the shred of hope that we will pick up where we left off, when I know this isn’t going to happen. I can’t let go of the relationships that didn’t work because I am unable to create new ones. I’m alone as I’ve ever been. I can’t even have guy friends because I’m bad with competition.

"Consider this post: ""Intense feelings of not wanting to exist/ wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever I'm a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school. I've been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it. I feel like I don't have any actual friends even though I go out a lot, and I feel like I have no impact on other people's lives, like they can go on so easily without me being there. On top of that, I feel like I don't belong anywhere since leaving highschool. I feel like I don't have a place in college, even though I got into my first choice school. However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything.

"Consider this post: ""Friend is badgering me to give them stuff, and frankly it's making me feel less inclined to reciprocate. So. I'm going to use fake names for these people instead of referring to them as mere pronouns. Me = The CrazyCOKids Orlando = The guy who is badgering me because, well, Orlando *is* the name of a character in Redwall who is a badger. Grath = Second person Fallow = Someone else, mutual friend of all of ours. So. Grath and I decide to do something together just the two of us. However, Orlando is a bit... *jealous*. Like, all the time someone else I'll refer to as Fallow wants to do something with me or Grath. Orlando seems to have this... massive victim complex. This isn't entirely unjustified mind you^ , but the problem is, he tends to extend this to friends. If say, Grath or Fallow decide to do something together, Orlando assumes he is being excluded on purpose and maliciously. See, we basically want to be friends with each other, rather than being ""by association"". (ever hang out with a group of people, yet you realise the only reason you know some of them is because another person brings 'em along? yeah.) We basically don't wanna just be ""Orlando's friend"" or ""Grath's buddy"", or ""Crazy's friend"" to each other. So we're intentionally doing some things with each other. Orlando, however, wants to be included in *everything*, and thinks that if people are doing something without him, he's being excluded intentionally and maliciously. So at first we didn't mention what we were doing, because Orlando would come in private and ask ""You going to do me next?"" or start going all ""Oh nobody ever thinks to include me I'm always the one left out"" or starts trying to guilt-trip us. But then, well, that obviously made him think that we were hiding stuff from him. Whenever we went to him first (and boy do we ever) he doesn't complain, and frankly it seems like we really shouldn't have to run everything through him because we're not in grade school still and you know, oftentimes if we *do* run it past him and ask if he would like to get involved he complains that he feels like 'the third wheel' or 'like we're just including him to be nice'. :/ Then he decides to start harassing us asking if we'll include him in things, essentially demanding we do things to him to make it up, then doing things like ""I just want to be included so then I can at least enjoy this thing"". So he guilt-trips us with how bad his (admittedly shitty) homelife is to try and get us to do things one-on-one with him or give him gifts. Enough is enough. Simply put we wanna put our feet down - again. Except! I know what'll happen. Orlando will take it as an act of aggression and with malicious intent. Grath will start complaining at Orlando for (admittedly) being immature about the whole thing. He'll start acting like we're ganging up on him, even though we're trying to tell him that when he asks for stuff in private the way he is, that we're only doing it just to shut him up. i've tried telling him to try organising things himself for a change so he's not always going ""Hey! Wait for me!"" but he doesn't seem to get it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. While there are descriptions of frustration, annoyance, and conflict with a friend, the overall tone of the post does not convey a deep sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or despair.

"Consider this post: ""Need honest opinions on my living situation. So about 6 months ago, my father had an accident which left him disabled. He lived in a 1 story ranch home. Being the only child that would be able to take care of my Dad, I moved my husband and 2 children to my dads house. Our house needed so much work, we wanted to sell it anyways, his house being 1 level worked so much better for him, allowed him to get around easier. So my father has gotten a little better, can take care of himself in the bathroom, needs helps with cleaning, cooking etc. also can’t drive. We are still living with my dad. The living situation has really worked out for us all. I am a stay at home mom, so taking care of my dad and 2 children is very much manageable. My husband and I do have our own space in the house as well. Sooo can someone please tell me why I’m so embarrassed to tell people of our living situation? Everyone knows what happened to my dad, everyone knows he needs me but I sort of feel like a failure. I guess because we don’t own our own house. We have done so much work and updating to my fathers house to make it our own. We pay almost all of the bills too. I love that we are all together I’m just sick of telling the whole story of how my dad got hurt and why I had to move in with him and why we don’t own our own house.

"Consider this post: ""I don't know what my problem is Hello, I've never posted here before. I'm a 28 year old guy and have a decent job that I like, it's quiet and involves a lot of puzzle solving and I'm pretty good at it. I've never had a ton of friends because I'm very particular and not very open with people so it takes a long time to build up relationships, but the friends I do have are outstanding and I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm kind of the funny guy but my humor is very blue. I got bullied a lot in grade school and learned to make people laugh because it'd get them to not make fun of me. I think it just kind of stuck. I don't know if any of that information is really important, just wanted to give it in case that's something that people do here. For at least 5 years, I have a hard time doing anything outside of my job alone without crawling up inside my head. All the things that I used to do for enjoyment like listening to music or playing video games, I just can't do anything anymore. It's like a wave of apathy that very rarely lifts. Occasionally, I pick up a razor blade and will press it into my shoulder or hand and I don't really know why to be honest. I don't know if I like the pain or maybe I like having something else to focus on for a minute. Or just to feel something that isn't apathy for a moment. I think about dying sometimes. Why we're here, what's the point if it ends the same. I doubt I'd ever kill myself because there are things I care about here that I wouldn't leave behind like that, mainly my mom and brother. I worry my brother will end up like me. Is there anything I can do? I don't know what a pill could do for me or if a pill works. I think the brain is so complex that it couldn't, but I guess I don't know. I don't want to be in a mental fog or be unaware or not be me anymore. I've also always kind of thought that it's human nature to feel this way: that everybody gets down, gets bored, thinks about their mortality, etc. and that I'm just being soft and need to suck it up. Life is difficult, I just need to learn to deal with it maybe. I don't know what's going on but I don't like feeling like that. If I'm hanging out with friends or family I'm usually fine, it's being alone with myself and having time alone where I can't entertain myself and waste away. I can't really explain it. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you? I've never talked to a therapist or anything like that and understand you cannot give a diagnosis on here, but if you know any methods to help me get out of that feeling, I'd be eternally grateful. Is this what depression feels like and I've just been in denial about having it for years?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits several emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a lack of enjoyment or pleasure in activities they used to find enjoyable, such as listening to music or playing video games. They express a persistent feeling of apathy and emptiness, as well as occasional self-harming behaviors. The mention of thoughts about death and contemplating the meaning of life suggests a deep existential despair.

He blocked my phone number and he completely blocked me on all social media’s. All because he got tired of listening to me talk about how I feel. I told him today I wished I was dead and I felt all alone. And he blocked me. Maybe he really doesn’t care if something happened to me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses deep emotional distress and feelings of abandonment. The poster describes seeking support and understanding from their boyfriend regarding their depression, but instead, their boyfriend chooses to block them on all communication platforms.
