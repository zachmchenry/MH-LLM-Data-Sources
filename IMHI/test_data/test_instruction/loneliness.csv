I had such great experiences and growth this year, but it feels like it hasn't given me the fulfilment I really want.

Christmas and New Year's are over, and I still feel this melancholy weight blanketing me that won't go away. But I'm expected to go to work parties and parties with friends and partake in festivities that I do not at all take pleasure in. I'm expected to smile and participate in these rituals, even by the people who know me well enough to know that I want to be miles away from anything to do with a holiday.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter. But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come, Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb. I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay. To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown. So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone... Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand. Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband. But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down, To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown. Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do. Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue. That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert, To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt. However in both situations, I would simply end up dead. That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head.

My therapist was scheduling my appointments for this month and the first week of the month was booked when my time to schedule came. She put me on a wait list. I didn't expect a call mostly due to logistics. How did I feel? I was triggered. I felt ignored and taken for granted, but I didn't say anything because that means I have confront one of my demons.

I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. This kinda feels the way church used to.

I have now severed my relationships with most of them out of fear. I don‚Äôt know who I can trust anymore. I know I can‚Äôt trust myself."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of paranoia and mistrust towards friends, as well as fear and a sense of being betrayed.

"Consider this post: ""Hi guys, I might need some help. I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge. I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them. I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say. So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while. The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression. Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct. Again, I don't know if this was the right place to go, but I had to talk to someone about it."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's reliance on alcohol whenever they feel down, highlighting a potential coping mechanism for dealing with negative emotions. The poster mentions feeling better and more social when they are drunk, suggesting a desire for connection and escape from their problems.

"Consider this post: ""I've had severe depression for pretty much my entire life, but that feeling has changed recently. There's now a constant weight in my chest as opposed to only sometimes.

Some of the text feels like jaded ramblings but other parts feel like a punch in the gut. I'm 31, my career is a trainwreck right now, got no friends anymore nor a SO and parents are getting old so soon I won't even have a family. Parts of this text that talk about social capital really resonate with me since many of the examples it mentions I did experience before but couldn't figure out what was happening at the time. It felt like when you realize nobody was laughing with you but at you. But worst of all is that I have nothing to counter those arguments, in particular the ones in the first half of it. It was a very disturbing reading, at least for me."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of depression, loneliness, and a sense of hopelessness. The poster mentions avoiding toxic parts of the internet to protect their mental health, suggesting that they are already struggling with negative emotions.

I have nowhere to go. I have no friends whatsoever, and no family that will even give me the time of day. No degrees or certifications. My credit is terrible and I'm several grand in debt.

Thinking of the blue tooth ****** camera/app? Sure any one of those things can happen with me, but not all in one day for me for years. I was on my game. It's times like that when I know I have a mental illness. That is me. And I don't get to see it often."" I just had two days of what I guess was a manic episode. I was me and anything was possible. And now I'm back where I've been. fuck."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness.

"Consider this post: ""I feel really weird doing this. I'm not good at talking about this stuff. But I have a couple reasons to think unloading anonymously might help a little. I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about half my life, since I was in middle school. Had a couple close calls, but had my first genuine attempt last summer. I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today. I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived. I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet. This is hard for me to type. I feel like I'm just an attention seeker. And, hey, maybe I am. I don't know. I don't even feel like I should be posting here. I'm not really an immediate threat to myself. I'm just desperate. This is the hardest night I've had in a while. I just want to feel something else."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness.

I am now 25 and 2017 was the happiest year of my life, but the past week I have been completely unmotivated. I do not want to die, but I have lost all desire to live. I search for joy and find fleeting moments. The love that is right in front of me feels like a far away flame. I watch the days pass me by and sleep seems to be the only thing I enjoy.""

People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes. (I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive). A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"". But I get told to change. As if I don't deal with my own? It makes no sense. Does anyone else do this? Face isolation because people misunderstand their emotional turmoil? This has caused me great hardship, stress, and mental breakdown. It'd be nice to feel normal. Thank you for reading."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of isolation, misunderstanding, and frustration towards the way others perceive the poster. The mention of being judged based on defense mechanisms and feeling like a permanent smear of mistakes suggests a lack of understanding and acceptance from others, contributing to feelings of loneliness.

During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing.. When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it.

Reasoning: The post mentions a history of being exposed to sexual activities at a young age, including hearing parents having sex and being groped by older men. The poster expresses confusion and distress over their own arousal in these situations, which suggests a complex emotional response.

Im scared they will just call me crazy or put me on pills that make me sleep or make my hair fall out. I'm too scared to go to therapy. I don't like talking to people about my problems."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses fear, anxiety, and reluctance to seek help or therapy. The poster mentions being told to get help and suspecting they have borderline personality disorder, but expressing fear of being judged or misunderstood by doctors.

"Consider this post: ""They say I have low self-esteem. I say: I have a realistic view of myself and my abilities. It's not about comparing myself to other people. There is always going to be someone better. SomeONES. I'm probably not even average on most of the metrics that matter. It's just... this is who I was ten years ago, and it's going to be who I am twenty years from now. I'm slowly coming to terms with that fact, but it leaves a major question: if this is me, and I'm not worth very much at all, then what justification is there to keep on grinding on, day after day, just to pay some other fucker's mortgage on their third home?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: While the post does mention having low self-esteem and a realistic view of oneself, it does not explicitly mention feelings of loneliness.

Recently, my depression has been super bad and I've been hoping for some other support besides the usual ""but your life seems to be going well"" and ""dont be to hard on yourself"" that I get from my parents.

The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given. Hell, im only 17 and I already feel stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that im going to be in stuck in for 2017 and the rest of my fucking life. If anyone is going through even a somewhat similar situation please let me know because i feel so alone with this."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of depression, hopelessness, and a lack of connection with others.

"Consider this post: ""Not only did I sleep until 2, but I drove to Dairy Queen and spent $10 on fast food. I've also picked 2 new scabs into my face due to anxiety. I forced myself to play Skyrim for an hour, but grew bored rather quickly. I'm also returning to school tomorrow, which I fucking hate. (SPOILER) 2018 is as awful as 2017."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions sleeping until 2, spending money on fast food, picking scabs out of anxiety, and feeling bored while playing a video game. These activities and behaviors suggest a lack of engagement and fulfillment in the poster's life. Additionally, the statement 'I'm also returning to school tomorrow, which I fucking hate' indicates a lack of enjoyment and potentially social connection in a significant aspect of their life. The closing sentence '2018 is as awful as 2017' suggests a general pessimistic and negative outlook, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness. While the post does not explicitly mention loneliness, the combination of isolated behaviors, lack of enjoyment, and negative outlook suggest a possible experience of loneliness."
"Consider this post: ""I'm in my junior year of college and lately my depression has been getting to the point where i can't help but constantly think about either dying somehow or outright killing myself. I can tell that i'm isolating myself from all of my friends. I rarely answer texts and if i'm invited to go out, i either don't respond or make up an excuse. Lots of people have told me they miss seeing me but no one has considered asking me how i'm doing. I feel like i'm being selfish by wanting them to ask me how i am rather than going to them and talking about how badly i'm struggling to just go about my everyday life. I also don't want to go to them with this kind of thing because it's a pretty heavy topic to just bring up out of the blue and i don't want to scare anyone. I don't even know if any of this makes sense so maybe someone else has felt similarly?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of depression, isolation, and thoughts of self-harm or suicide, which are strong indicators of loneliness. The poster mentions isolating themselves from friends, rarely answering texts, and making excuses to avoid going out, which further suggests a withdrawal from social interactions. The statement that ""no one has considered asking me how I'm doing"" and the feeling of being selfish for wanting someone to ask about their wellbeing highlight a sense of loneliness and a desire for emotional support.

The focus is on the impact of depression and anxiety on the person's cognitive abilities, rather than a deep sense of loneliness."
"Consider this post: ""ive had this sentence typed: im so goddamn tired of and i keep typing things im tired of, then backspacing. things like how im tired of being incredibly lazy and not doing something constructive. or how im tired that i draw like absolute shit and am truly at the bottom rung of a hierarchy of artists. tired of hating me. but its all just meaningless. at the end of the day, im just tired of being tired. i guess theres nothing else to say"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of frustration, self-criticism, and exhaustion, but it does not directly mention feelings of loneliness.

"Consider this post: ""The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to. The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die. I'm afraid that if I don't act now, I'll regret it and have to endure life for another year, but I'm also not 100% set on death just yet."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: the poster expresses a desire to die and discusses a specific method of suicide. However, the focus of the post is not on feelings of loneliness but rather on the decision-making process and logistical details of the suicide attempt.

We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man. I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful. &amp;#x200B; For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me. &amp;#x200B; I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't.

"Consider this post: ""So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of frustration and sadness, as well as a feeling of being trapped in a cycle of good and bad days.

"Consider this post: ""I have so many things that make me feel sad, especially right now, but I don't talk about them with others, even though I have some lovely friends, because I don't want to place the burden of myself upon them. Even though I have no evidence this will happen I am gripped by the fear that they will think I'm annoying (oversharing?) when I think about telling them this stuff, or I start to think about how maybe they will abandon me if they knew how sad I really was. I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already.""

A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling. Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night. I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally? Please help anyone who has gone through something similar or knows someone who has gotten better as I've become a shell of myself.. going from perfect breathing to feeling like I'm walking around with a bag over my head all day is devastating and the real kicker is I'm not even happy with the cosmetic result but at this point I just want to breathe again,,,"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness.

My issue is that I don‚Äôt have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? I never do homework, I never study, and these days it‚Äôs actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôd pass with a C or above. But now I‚Äôm getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can‚Äôt find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my ‚Äúeducation‚Äù.

Some of my interests have changed, things physically feel different, I don't feel as invested in my relationships, and in a strange way I miss my depression because it was like a comforting imaginary friend that was always there.

"Consider this post: ""that feeling you get that everything is pointless and your life is basically just a waste and you are only an apendage."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling that everything is pointless, that life is a waste, and that the person is only an appendage.

Loneliness often leads to questioning the purpose and meaning of one's life, and feeling like an appendage suggests a lack of belonging and connection to others."
"Consider this post: ""I don't wanna live like this. I'm typing as I'm sobbing cause it's just hit me that it won't ever get any better. This is it for me. I promised myself that I would hold on until I could leave my family in a better financially. Until my grandma passed away so I couldn't save her up the pain. But I'm suffering so much. No one fucking likes me. And I don't say anything but god it hurts. It hurts being alone. It hurts being rejected. I've tried to keep going. And perhaps tomorrow I'll wake up and go to work like nothing happened. But tonight I wanna pretend I'm dying. That when I fall asleep it'll be the last time I see this fucking planet.

Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness.

But none of these things work now fuck"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions several unhealthy coping mechanisms that the poster used to deal with an underlying feeling of emptiness or ""void."" They mention binge eating, starving themselves, watching YouTube videos, getting drunk, and sleeping as ways to fill the void or escape from it. The use of profanity at the end of the post suggests frustration and desperation, indicating that none of these coping mechanisms are effective anymore.

"Consider this post: ""I've been going to therapy for about 5 months now and I've noticed some improvements in my anxiety and depression. I've been going through CBT which has lots of research support, but I always find myself slacking off on changing my behaviours and when I do that. I revert back to being depressed and suicidal. I guess I'm kind of looking for an easy fix as crazy as that sounds. Those who have gone on medication like Zoloft, Ativan, Xanax, Prozac. How was your experience with them?

Reasoning: The post mentions attending therapy for anxiety and depression and acknowledges some improvements in those areas. However, the poster also expresses feelings of slacking off on changing behaviors and experiencing periods of depression and suicidal thoughts.

"Consider this post: ""I make fun of my friend for being skinny and punch her around. I jab at my other friend everytime she makes a little mistake. I'm an asshole.

From my personal experience, Ive always heard that having a therapist to treat your depression can be helpful sometimes but many times, from what I hear, the patient continues to suffer from depression. What is something that others can do to help a victim of depression? From your personal experience, what do you believe could be extremely helpful when treating or helping those with depression? I am genuinely curious and eager for ANY feedback due to my desire of assisting others."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness.

"Consider this post: ""Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3. In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..) I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since. Please help, happy to answer any more questions, and sorry if I've broken any rules; I'm new to reddit."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness.

The feelings of suffocation, drowning, and continuously feeling sick indicate a deep sense of despair and loneliness. The poster also mentions experiencing anxiety and feeling extremely anxious at their job, which further reinforces the feelings of loneliness and distress. The unexpected diagnosis and subsequent downhill spiral also contribute to the sense of loneliness and helplessness expressed in the post."

There is no coming back from this"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness.

"Consider this post: ""Coping is no longer working. I'm not actively suicidal, but passive. I'm peeling my fingers bloody. Chewing my lip bloody. I want to shave my head. The last time I did that I was 21 and in serious need of mental health help. Or a hug. Who knows. I have chronic pain that is awful the last few years, relationship problems that he won't work out with me because he chooses to be stubborn and stand offish. I don't know how much more of life I can handle without cracking and shattering. It's been mostly bias and loneliness with a few brief happy moments. I've inherited every crazy gene in the family on top of that. I don't know how much I can take. So I want to shave my head because that will help.. somehow, I don't know. I'm just struggling in general. I don't know how to cope anymore. Journaling helps for a few minutes. Crafting helps for a few minutes. Standing in the sun helps for a few minutes. I don't know how else to feel better because nothing feels better for long. I automatically start rocking in a chair every time I sit in it, I'm rocking myself as I wrote this. The chair isn't a rocking chair."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of despair and struggle.

I have depressive episodes where I can't get out of bed, feel numb towards emotions, want to be left alone/don't want to talk to people, unproductive. But I also feel like I have high anxiety?

Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of sadness, failure, and a lack of support in real life. The poster mentions crying in bed and feeling like a failure, which indicates a deep emotional state.

The closing sentence 'Fuck this hole' conveys frustration and discontentment, and together with the overall tone of the post, indicates a strong emotional impact and a deeper experience of loneliness."
"Consider this post: ""Ive been going through so much at this point, and I want to let it out all out so please bear with me since I'm just depressed at this point. You might relate to this. I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types. They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time. I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else. My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit.

I have always felt like I never belonged to this world, because I am ""too imaginative"" and ""too kind"". I behave ""not like how people should"". I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo. Everyone does. It's final exam time for us, and I have to secure good marks, otherwise I won't be able to enter any good streams in a good college. It would be the end of my future. My family is in a financial crunch, but they give up everything for me. I am dead-set on helping my friends get through their depression and suicidal tendencies, but I'm failing at that. I have had three attempts, but I was saved by a person, who himself was alexithymic (I think) and suicidal. He still is, and he says if he doesn't do well, he will commit suicide. I don't know what I'm gonna do if I don't perform the way I should. But I certainly know that I will die if he does. In case everything goes wrong, I'll leave. There's no other way. The day of my death is nearing. It's just 3 months away. Love you all. Have a good day."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post conveys a deep sense of sadness, despair, and hopelessness, which are often associated with loneliness. The poster mentions struggling with severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder, and DID, which indicates a high level of emotional distress. The statements 'I have always felt like I never belonged to this world' and 'I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo' suggest feelings of isolation and not fitting in with others. The mention of failing to help friends with depression and suicidal tendencies and having had three suicide attempts demonstrates a lack of support and connection. The statement 'I will die if he does' reveals a strong reliance on another person for emotional support and a fear of being alone.

"Consider this post: ""It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time. The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it. Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses a range of emotions and experiences that indicate loneliness. The poster mentions difficulty sleeping and experiencing nightmares, which can be symptoms of anxiety and loneliness. The comment about the poster's husband being ""too good"" to them and feeling unworthy of his love suggests low self-esteem and a lack of belief in one's own worthiness of companionship. The statement about looking out the window and wondering if anyone thinks of them and if they are worthy of friendship further emphasizes feelings of isolation and longing for connection. The mention of therapy and the therapist asking about goals also implies that the poster is actively seeking help and support, likely due to feelings of loneliness.

Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space. You know when you can feel a massive load of tears just behind your face waiting to come out at any second? I've had that for a while now, both a mixture of happiness and sadness I am so alone, I can't talk to anyone to figure out what's wrong with my because if anyone asks I just sit in silence because I have nothing to say What is wrong with me?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions a series of personal struggles, including isolation, loss of friends, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. The poster describes feeling alone and unable to talk to anyone about their problems. They express a sense of self-worthlessness, referring to themselves as a ""boring lonely gross waste of space."" The emotions conveyed in the post, including sadness, loneliness, and the desire to cry, indicate a deep sense of loneliness and a lack of social connection. The poster's question of ""What is wrong with me?"" implies a search for understanding and potentially reaching out for help, further emphasizing their feelings of loneliness."
"Consider this post: ""let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything"" I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of self-doubt, inadequacy, and frustration towards the best friend. The poster compares themselves to their best friend, highlighting the stark differences in achievements and abilities. They mention feeling like a waste and a piece of shit in comparison to their friend's perfection. The poster also mentions having a difficult home life and struggling with mental health issues, but their best friend dismisses their concerns and belittles their need for medication. They express reluctance to end the friendship due to a lack of other friends and the close relationship between their families. The poster concludes by stating that they feel like the friendship is toxic and that they feel like shit. The overall tone of the post suggests a deep sense of loneliness and isolation, as the poster feels inadequate, unsupported, and trapped in a friendship that is not meeting their emotional needs."
"Consider this post: ""So I recently went to a therapist, because I have severe depression. I cannot afford to keep going, and I was hoping someone might have some suggestions or exercises in general to stop feeling sad. I‚Äôm looking for things I can do on a daily basis to improve over time. Any help is appreciated!"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: While the post mentions severe depression and a desire for suggestions to stop feeling sad, it does not directly express feelings of loneliness. The focus of the post is more on finding ways to improve mental health and seeking help from others. The poster seems to be open to receiving support and suggestions, which suggests a willingness to connect with others. Therefore, the label of loneliness does not apply in this case."
"Consider this post: ""Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions that the friend has gone down a depression spiral, has panic attacks, and has attempted to hurt herself. These are all indicators of mental health struggles, but they do not directly imply loneliness. The poster expresses a desire to help and feels helpless in the situation, but this does not necessarily indicate their own feelings of loneliness. The primary focus of the post is on finding ways to support the friend and seeking suggestions for assistance."
"Consider this post: ""So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June. I didn't get another job until September. So here i am, only working there a few months, and this is the second time i've done a no call no show within 3 weeks. I can't get myself to get out of bed. I just turned 19. I had to have my mom call off for me the other day because i was having a mental breakdown. The jobs i have are not even stressful, but i'm so terrified to actually CALL and talk to a manager and tell them i can't come in, and it's not like being depressed is a work excuse. I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression? Or have any recommendations on jobs? I take medication, so there's nothing else to really help. I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks.."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions multiple instances of not showing up to work and having a mental breakdown. The poster also talks about feeling terrified to talk to a manager about their situation and how being depressed is not a valid work excuse. These statements indicate a struggle with maintaining a job due to mental health issues. The poster also mentions feeling useless if they don't work, suggesting a need for a sense of purpose and potentially a fear of isolation or loneliness if they were to not have a job. The statement ""I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks"" suggests a cyclical pattern of struggling with depression and functioning at work, further indicating a potential sense of loneliness and isolation related to their mental health struggles."
"Consider this post: ""When will I find someone who‚Äôll love me forever and ever"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness.

"Consider this post: ""Anyone gotten off this drug? I am reading the inter webs and having the crap scared out of me. Been on it about 18 months..."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions reading the internet and feeling scared, which suggests a sense of anxiety or distress. The mention of being on the drug for 18 months implies a possible struggle or dependency. While the post does not explicitly mention loneliness, the overall tone of fear and distress can be indicative of a feeling of isolation or lack of support. The poster may be seeking advice or connection from others who have gone through a similar experience, suggesting a potential sense of loneliness."
"Consider this post: ""Every single day the thought that keeps me from driving off the road on my way home is a nap. But nightmares are worse lately. I dream vividly every night. Im so tired. So exhausted. Too tired to type a long story. Im too tired to even write a note"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions the thought of driving off the road and nightmares, indicating a possible struggle with mental health. The statement ""every single day the thought that keeps me from driving off the road on my way home is a nap"" suggests that the poster relies on distractions, such as napping, to cope with their negative thoughts. The mention of being tired, exhausted, and too tired to write further suggests a feeling of loneliness, as the poster may lack energy or motivation to engage in social activities or reach out to others for support. Additionally, the mention of vivid dreams every night might indicate an escape from the reality of loneliness during sleep."
"Consider this post: ""I've been going through a rough patch. I was recently diagnosed with mild depression and GAD and have worry reduction group therapy in a few weeks. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk or turn to without feeling guilty or like I am making a meal out of how i'm feeling. I try and help people who have more stressful things going on as a distraction technique but I am now feeling like I should just stop messaging or contacting people because at least then, I wont feel guilty about bothering someone. I have tried monitoring sleep but that has stopped and I am sleeping less. I tried a mood diary app on my phone but that last about a month. I also tried coming off facebook for a few weeks, but didn't notice much difference. I'm at a bit of a stand still with regards of what to do. I'm not too sure what to expect from writing this or if i'll get anything out of it. But i think the anonymity of it helps a little."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions going through a rough patch and being diagnosed with mild depression and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). The poster mentions feeling like they don't have anyone to talk to without feeling guilty or like they are burdening others. They express a sense of isolation and a lack of support. The poster also mentions trying various techniques to cope with their emotions, such as distraction and monitoring sleep and mood, but none of them seem to be working effectively. They express feeling unsure of what to do and a sense of stagnation. This combination of feeling isolated, lacking support, and experiencing difficulties in finding effective coping mechanisms suggests a strong presence of loneliness. The closing sentence 'But I think the anonymity of it helps a little' implies that the poster finds some solace in expressing their thoughts anonymously, further indicating a sense of loneliness and a need for connection."

"Consider this post: ""I don't enjoy the ""nice"" things other people seem to enjoy. Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is ""How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing."" Especially reading a book. Dear God, I could never distract myself from the disconnect I feel inside of me to enjoy reading a book Why don't I get that little rush of dopamine from behavior others find rewarding?""

"Consider this post: ""I hate that you have no defense when someone disagrees with you. ""It's your depression talking."" No, shithead, maybe you're treating me like crap and I have a legitimate reason to be unhappy about that. Except you have to defend that because the immediate assumption is you being negative - and you're not even sure yourself. You practically help them gaslight you. I hate that the only people who talk to you are miserable failures like yourself, talking about being miserable failures. What you need is a way out of hell, not more company there. And most functional people either don't know what the hell is like, or having left, can't go near it for fear of being dragged back. I know I wouldn't want to. I hate that it fills you with so much energy and takes away any ability to release it. I hate that your choices with most new people are to be a non-entity, or a drain on their energy because they have to deal with you. I hate that for most of the medications I've tried anyway, it doesn't take away the sad, it merely allows you to function through it. Even if it does, it ultimately isn't enough if you don't have at least a bit of genuine happiness to hold on to. I hate that you start to despise the coping mechanisms that you develop.

"Consider this post: ""What I mean by this, is that they care to hear how you're doing and stuff, and they do care of your existence. For example, if you fall ill, they may say something like ""Well, I hope ____ feels better soon!"" That kind of thing. But a lot of people don't care about you, they care *of* you. If they aren't the kind of person who talks and listens to you, then I feel like that means they only care of you. I have a bunch of family members who I only talk to when I see them, like on holidays. Those people, unfortunately, don't care about me. They care of me. I feel like there's a difference. I don't know if know if these are warbled depression thoughts, or if I'm just realizing this, but it seems to be the case. I know telling people about depression is usually overwhelming, but I can't help but feel so brushed off. I hate when I tell people stuff like ""I'm not feeling too well lately, and my life has gotten pretty rough,"" and they'll simply dismiss it with an ""Oh, okay.""

"Consider this post: ""A close friend of mine, over the internet, told me that she was sorry. This was out of the blue, because the last time we talked we were really happy. I asked what for, and she said she broke a promise. I didn't understand, but then she said she hurt herself. I asked her why and she said she just did deserve it. I tried my best, but she just ended with ""I'm sorry"". I attempted to convince her, since I have a history with suicide attempts and depression. She said ""I can't promise anything"". She wanted to go offline for a while, so I just wanted to let her know how I felt. I told her ""I love you."" and she said ""I love you too"". She isn't single, she's dating my friend, but I have a huge crush on her, and we are really close. It happened 4 hours ago from when I posted this, and I'm extremely concerned what happened. ""I love you too"" is the last thing she said to me. She hasn't said anything since, and I feel extremely depressed because I may have been unable to stop my closest friend from committing suicide.""

My life continued for others, never myself. Yesterday my father explained to me how much I've affected people - in this moment I was faced with the truth I put off for more than 11 years. Being alive hurts people - financially, emotionally and physically. The only reason I am alive has been conflicted - this is when I realized I was fucked.

"Consider this post: ""I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then. About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there. Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing. When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her. I think if I fuck up and constantly bug her about things, that she'll be closer to the door. I guess I'm just feeling shitty today and I wish I could just change it. Hope all of you are trying to stay positive as well."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness.

The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful. And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this. We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things. I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal. A bad friend. Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day. Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves. Why people killed themselves. Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue. Maybe it was people like me.

You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all.

I've always suffered from mild depression but I was alright until about 5 years ago bulimia snuck in. Right before my eyes it creeped into a crippling depression, but I can't even place when it got this bad. I get happy for moments and my mind quickly tells me it won't last and puts me back in my place I don't feel like anyone close to me fully understands. Yesterday I went to a party with close friends and hardly spoke to anyone. To make matters worse, a guy I used to talk to that was flirting with a good friend of mine and now I'm anxious that they think that's why I was upset when really my depression just felt like it was a good time to kick in. Which brings me to my severe social anxiety.......long spiraling story short I've only gotten out of bed once today to make a sandwich, ate said sandwich in bed and went back to sleep.

Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing. Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it. And still no one asking about me in the main chat. It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier. This is just cruel. I'm not looking forward to our next game when I have to be around them...""

I can't tell my friends because none are close enough and even if they were... they wouldn't care. They'd care on the surface, but the next day it's back to their lives and that's that. That doesn't make them bad friends...I'd probably be the same way. Everyone has their own problems they don't need to be hassled with mine. I don't know what I'm looking for with this post or if I'm even looking for anything. I guess it's more for me... to just tell someone... even if it's just to one of you random people that actually read this.

However, just know that with the right doctor and the right combination of medications, it will subside almost completely. If you‚Äôre constantly feeling this pain, then something is clearly wrong with your treatment. Just know that it does get better. It does get easier.

And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO. It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life.

But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice?

"Consider this post: ""hi everyone I had been doing so well, I was a year and two months SH-clean. I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars. but tonight brought on an depressive episode that I‚Äôve never experienced before. on my way home, I was wailing/sobbing, talking out loud to myself about what was wrong with me, and then I had a thought that ceased the wailing and brought me to complete silence for the rest of the night. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill myself.‚Äù When I got home, I got into comfortable pajamas and researched lethal doses of the medicines I have in my cabinet. I wrote out a note, telling my family and friends that I love them. I was nearly about to take the pills, when my cat came around the corner and started purring. She rubbed herself around my ankles, meowing at me happily. I broke down in tears, realizing what I was about to do. I later cut myself, which I justified to myself as being an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù to suicide. Time to start the countup over."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post describes the poster's experience of a depressive episode that they have never experienced before. The mention of wailing, sobbing, and talking out loud to themselves suggests intense emotions and feelings of despair. The thought of suicide and the actions taken by the poster to research lethal doses of medication and write a goodbye note indicate a deep sense of hopelessness and loneliness.

The post also mentions self-harm as an alternative to suicide, indicating that the poster is struggling with severe emotional pain and lack of proper coping mechanisms. Overall, the post shows strong indicators of loneliness and emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago). my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit. I'm afraid of freezing up and being incapable of speaking honestly. but knowing this is my anxiety speaking, it'll probably go well and be over before I know it... or it could seem to last an eternity and I'll feel trapped the whole time, as per usual. don't know why I've typed this. guess it would be nice to receive some advice, experiences, what to say, etc. not expecting replies though. gonna take a hot shower, then ponder about this until I fall asleep. goodnight. edit: wording."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions the poster's decision to start medication and therapy for severe anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. These mental health conditions can often contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.

"Consider this post: ""Everything I've had in life has slowly been ruined by anxiety. Friends I used to talk with constantly are now either gone or distant because I just can't keep up with them anymore. I've separated from so much of my family because of my own choices and shitty habits. I'm unable to beat them. For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud. I've lost every job the same way. Whether it's throwing up in the bathrooms at work or failing to muster up the courage to even call in sick, it finds its place in the worst possible ways without fail. It's been like this for years. I live at home with no job, no car, not even highschool degree four years after I should have graduated. I don't even have a driver's licence. I've been hospitalized twice, both times in relation to this problem that just won't go away. Nothing works. Every day I'm met with opportunities but pass on every single one of them. I'm young, I'm healthy, and I know I'm still capable. I have so many choices and yet it feels like there are none anymore."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses feelings of isolation and deep loneliness.

"Consider this post: ""I seriously have so much anxiety in me going on that I can‚Äôt stand it any more, only thing I do is lay in bed and do nothing at all. I am diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and take medicine but it does not help. I had a lot of therapy but nothing helped. All my thoughts are going round the same topic: what can I do today to help myself? Meditation? Active things? Take a bath? Read a book? What should I do?!?! And this repeats till I go to bed again and my results are that I did nothing. Lol. How can I break this crazy cycle?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post mentions feeling a lot of anxiety and not being able to handle it. The poster mentions lying in bed and doing nothing, which could indicate a lack of motivation or engagement with activities. The repetition of thoughts and the struggle to find ways to help themselves suggest a lack of effectiveness in coping mechanisms.

"Consider this post: ""After many years of variety of meds for a variety of things (ADHD, depression, sleep, bipolar), I decided to self-medicate with coffee, melatonin, excercise, a therapy light, and running my own business rather than having to follow stupid rules. Actually, the self-medication thing worked pretty well. It probably helps that I've lived with a physician for many years. However, the business did not go well, and I'm back to being full-time employed for someone else. Basically, I'd need to make an appointment in St. Paul before work or after work, but I'd prefer weekends. I know this is not a TwinCities specific board, but with 160k readers, I figure there might be someone from around here."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","No, the poster does not suffer from loneliness. Reasoning: The post does not mention any feelings of loneliness.

I want someone to hold me and prove me wrong and tell me that I‚Äôm valued and not worthless. When I‚Äôm alone, all I have are shitty thoughts and memories that tell me how worthless I am. I probably don‚Äôt even need a paid professional like a therapist, since I know that I‚Äôm paying them to tell me some bullshit. I just want a simple human connection to tell me that it‚Äôs worth it to stay here."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep longing for someone to hold them and validate their worth.

I don't have the power to come back from this. I feel so empty. I'm living a lie. 2018 will change nothing. Every day is a new year from the last, if people were really going to change they would have done it by now"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of loss and despair. The poster mentions having everything - a relationship, amazing friends, and security - but all of it has slipped away.

"Consider this post: ""I really cannot do this anymore. It's like my suffering has spread onto those I love and I'm at a point where I can no longer put on a fake smile. I can no longer pretend that I'm okay because I'm not. I hate seeing my friends and family hurt for me and it breaks my heart seeing them feel so helpless. My life is such a failure and I've already ruined it so much that there's literally no point in going on. I fall asleep crying every night because I realized that I'm the problem here and my existence only makes the lives of others worse. People keep telling me how much they love me and how much I have to live for and while that does mean something to me, it's not enough to make me want to live. With my existence, I hurt people and with my death, I'll hurt people, so what's the point? At least if I die eventually the hurt will begin to fade (or so I hope). I just want the people I love to live a life without worries or hurt and all I do is hurt them. I have 2 more weeks to finish this quarter of school. Before I decide to end my ""wonderful"" life I just want to finish this one quarter, not that I'm going to achieve anything. I just want to push through these last 2 weeks but even that's been extremely difficult. I cry every single day in agony that I have to live another day and it's so hard trying to even study for exams because I have no ability to concentrate or take anything in. All that I want to do is be ridden of this pain."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness.

"Consider this post: ""Mindless Self Indulgence - It Gets Worst comes to mind immediately. This song is pretty much my theme song. I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot. Behemoth, Shade Empire, Dimmu Borgir, Hate. Great bands. Since I am usually not happy, I rather sit and listen to music that is about death, destruction, hatred, pain, misanthorpy, war, and satanism. All the dark shit. I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace. It fits in with usually how I feel. If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless. Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place. I should have my vocal cords removed. I thought I would be happier because I got a better job, but being lonely really sucks a lot more than I thought it would.""

"Consider this post: ""From the time i remember myself i would always think im stupid and ugly and everybody else is better. From the time i was 14-15 i would imagine how to end it all.

But the last thing I want to do is talk to a stranger about my feelings or not wanting to go on, feeling hopeless, and just fed up. Because I refuse to take medication or be ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù and the only other person who understands is my friend, who is also suicidal. People who don‚Äôt suffer from depression, extreme loss in life, or daily struggles don‚Äôt understand that we don‚Äôt exactly want to die, but these feelings have to. Is it just me?

"Consider this post: ""I suspect that what I'm dealing with is a mixture of anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to talk to anyone yet. I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through!""

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine. But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind. I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide.

I‚Äôm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn‚Äôt want me to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made they‚Äôre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together.

I am just so happy and it‚Äôs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her.

There is loud music here, people dancing and drinking, people I know really since long now - celebrating a new year. I'm being pulled in for a drink and dancing - I pretend like I am enjoying. I don't want them to know. I don't want anyone to know. Why would anyone care? I somehow thought it would be a good idea to come here. I don't know why. Maybe better than sitting in front of a screen - playing stupid games or watching videos. I really wanted this to work. I need this for 2018. I'm not feeling good. It's going to be a bad year.

Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh.

"Consider this post: ""I guess this isn‚Äôt really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so they‚Äôll never experience that sadness. But ever since I‚Äôve been depressed (roughly 5 years now) I‚Äôve been the most cynical person. I hate other people‚Äôs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside I‚Äôm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore. I just feel like alien. Does anyone else feel this way? Or do you try to make other people happy to make up for you not being happy yourself? Does this help you, as in does other people‚Äôs happiness help to alleviate yours slightly? &amp; also, to people that don‚Äôt resent other people‚Äôs happiness, how? All I can think about is how unfair it is that others can be so happy when I‚Äôm hardly staying afloat I know I‚Äôm asking 100 questions but I‚Äôm just curious as to how people share a common disorder but respond to it in very different ways"" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness.

Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma. Half of me keeps slapping my weak and fragile other half, but I'm not making any steps forward."" Question: Does the poster suffer from loneliness?","Yes, the poster suffers from loneliness.

On New Years Eve, I told my boyfriend that I feel bad, that I'm wishing to have a car accident, that I just want everything to stop. He got angry, told me that I'm selfish and that I should stop with these thoughts. I would never ever kill myself, I could never do it. So no worries. I started hurting myself again, biting my arms, biting my lips. Nobody knows how I feel. Nobody. I feel alone even if I have a wonderful boyfriend and good friends.

No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either. I was in the middle, not bad enough to be hated, not good enough to be loved. I was content with this position for a while, but it was lonely. I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends. I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough. The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people. I have seen how people treat others who are different. They can be mean and cruel. Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise. I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it. People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself? I worry they would think I am weird and annoying, even though I don't mean to be at all. I just want to be accepted and appreciated as I am, but I worry people won't agree with that.""

But probably a month or two ago I got into a really bummed out state where I just needed support to get through it. But what did they do, pushed me away and said we don‚Äôt like being with you when you are sad because it brings the rest of us Down. That of course made me even sadder and they stopped inviting me to hang out with them after school and it‚Äôs really really hard for me.

So why did I get cripplingly depressed all of a sudden? The brief period where I was exposed to just a little too much lead as a kid? When I fell on my head and got a crack in my skull at age 2?

To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world.

Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared. You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable.

I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most. I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken. And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me. Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence.

"Consider this post: ""I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me. I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time... Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply ""break up"" with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier.

She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)?

It‚Äôs like if I‚Äôm enjoying myself heaps, like laughing with friends or watching cute animals, and realise that I‚Äôm having fun, and that thought triggers myself to say to myself that I will never be happy and this is a fleeting moment, and that thought itself acts as ‚Äòevidence that I‚Äôm depressed‚Äô which goes back into the cycle of negativity which de-purifies whatever enjoyment I‚Äôm feeling.

Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled.
