My teacher told me today that if I didn't do anything that would be more helpful than me actually trying to do something. I'm only 10 and I feel like no one my age should be feeling like this. I know you people are much older and have to deal with way worse problems but when your a goddamn 5th grader life shouldn't make you feel like your worthless.

"Consider this post: ""Hi, 23 M have been living with depression for at least 8 years, maybe longer i've kinda forgotten when it started its been so long. Been at the tipping point for a while now, although for some reason my death would upset some people so i refuse to do it as much as i want to. Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live. The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help? Like i don't actually like this world and even if my attitude changed my situation wouldn't, and if anything relying on pure hope to get me through another 50~ years of despair would just be more painful than accepting it?"" Question: Does the physical wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: The wellness dimension of physical aspect does not exist in the post. The individual expresses feelings of depression, thoughts of death, and a lack of desire to live. There is no mention of growth, changes in the body, or the adoption of healthy habits. The focus is primarily on emotional well-being and the lack of hope for improvement."

I‚Äôm stuck at home doing absolutely nothing. I know that I‚Äôm not a dumb person and that if I try I‚Äôll be able to do it. I know what I should be doing but can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not a child anymore and my family won‚Äôt support me forever. It hurts to watch everyone who believed in me and all of the people and friends in my life move on ahead while I feel stuck. I want to do what other people my age are doing. I want to build a future for myself where instead of being a burden I can instead help my family. I want to reach a place where I can do what I want without being held back. I feel like a phony and a big disappointment to everyone I meet and to myself. I know that I have so much potential but I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt know why. Am I just afraid to grow up ?

People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it. Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all.

You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts.

"Consider this post: ""Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past. I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning. Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... Now, here comes the real problem...

This shows an awareness of the impact their actions would have on their loved ones and illustrates the social aspect of wellness."
"Consider this post: ""I‚Äôve struggled with major depression since I was probably 14-15 and I‚Äôm 25 now. I‚Äôve tried several different medications and had many bad turn outs with that. I am on 200mg of Wellbutrin now and it seems to work well but every 6 months or so, I just get the fuck it‚Äôs and stop taking it. Like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt need this shit‚Äù. And then of course I‚Äôll get extremely down &amp; have many more suicidal ideations. I usually have them daily anyways. I realize I have to stop doing this, and I tell myself every single time that I won‚Äôt do it again, but I always do. Even though I am currently on an antidepressant it doesn‚Äôt make the suicidal thoughts go away. I can be having an okay day and I will still picture myself with a gun in my mouth or similar things. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever actually do anything to end my life for a few simple reasons ‚Äî my brother hung himself 4 years ago and I know how hard it was on me, my dad would be lost without me, and honestly because I have stuff in my room I wouldn‚Äôt want my parents to have to see or find (stupid I know but whatever works right). Anyways, I feel like I‚Äôm rambling but the point of my post is to see what other people do to stop these thoughts. Just looking for tips or ideas that I could try because it takes a toll on me after awhile and for fucks sake, id like to get through one whole day without thinking about offing myself. I‚Äôve tried some coping mechanisms such as journaling but I couldn‚Äôt ever stick with it."" Question: Does the vocational wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on the author's struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, as well as their attempts to find coping mechanisms. While mental wellness is certainly a component of overall wellness, the post does not specifically mention any work or vocational-related concerns or experiences. Therefore, the vocational aspect of wellness is not present in this post."

Question: Does the emotional wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: The wellness dimension of emotional aspect does not exist in the post. Although the individual openly discusses their struggle with major depression and suicidal thoughts, they also express a lack of consistency in taking their medication and a persistent presence of suicidal ideations. This indicates a possible resistance or denial of their own feelings, as well as a need for external advice and coping mechanisms to alleviate their distress."
"Consider this post: ""Its irony when my mom keeps bugging me like why wont I spend my time to talk with her instead of me sulking in my bedroom when everytime I talk to her,she always manage to either compare me with one of her friend's child who are far way more successful or reminds me of how much my dad not wanting me.I wish I was never alive."" Question: Does the spiritual wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post.

Question: Does the intellectual wellness dimension exist in the post?","Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post. Reasoning: The post discusses the individual's feelings of being compared to others and reminded of their father's lack of acceptance.

"Consider this post: ""So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself, I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it.

When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve.

Reasoning: In the post, the individual consistently expresses thoughts and preoccupations with death, both their own and others'. They mention thinking about scenarios where they are hit by a bus or have terminal cancer and constantly think about different situations where people in their life die tragically. This preoccupation with death indicates a deep contemplation about the meaning and purpose of life, as well as the emotions and existential questions that come with it. The individual also mentions their thoughts on how they would grieve and the impact of their death on others, which suggests a search for understanding and meaning in relation to their own mortality. This focus on death and existential questions aligns with the spiritual aspect of Dunn's model, as it reflects a search for meaning and purpose in human existence beyond the physical realm."

Reasoning: The post discusses the individual's experiences of feeling suicidal due to a variety of factors, including repeated failures in school, mistreatment by the individual's father, self-judgment, and lack of motivation. These factors indicate the presence of social interdependence, as the individual's experiences are influenced by their interactions with others (such as their father and peers) and societal pressures (such as the emphasis on academic success). The individual's mention of being a highly sensitive person and a procrastinator also suggests a connection between their personal characteristics and their experiences in the social realm. The individual's thoughts of suicide and desire to give up on life highlight their perception of themselves as disconnected or isolated from others and their environment, reflecting a lack of social wellness."

However, the individual's focus on suicide as a solution, without any indication of acceptance or understanding of their feelings, suggests a lack of wellness in the emotional aspect. They view suicide as a normal option and express a desire to give up on life, indicating a disconnection from their emotions rather than acceptance and understanding."

I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already."" Question: Does the vocational wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: The post does not explicitly mention any work-related concerns or vocational aspect. The focus is more on the individual's mental health struggles, fear of burdening others, and feelings of loneliness. Therefore, the wellness dimension of vocational aspect does not exist in this post according to Dunn's model of psychological wellness."

"Consider this post: ""Jan. 17, 2017 I told myself I was sick of going through every year wanting to die, wishing for death, and that if things hadn't changed I wouldn't see the start of 2018. For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point.

Reasoning: In the post, the individual describes their struggles with suicidal thoughts, hospitalizations, and feeling worse off. While this post indicates significant emotional distress, there is no mention of the search for meaning or purpose in human existence. The focus is on their personal struggles and feelings of despair, rather than seeking a greater understanding or purpose in life.

However, it also acknowledges that their mental state worsened and they attempted suicide multiple times in the past few months. While the post primarily focuses on their emotional and mental well-being, the mention of hospitalizations and being committed to a behavioral center suggests that there may also be an impact on their physical well-being. The lack of support and the individual's feelings of not having anyone to talk to further highlight the importance of addressing their overall wellness, including the physical aspect."

"Consider this post: ""Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD.

In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through.

I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice?

Therefore, the post does not reflect the wellness dimension of the spiritual aspect as defined by Dunn's model."

The individual expresses feelings of being an outsider, lacking close friends, and fantasizing about death. These factors contribute to a lack of fulfillment in their intellectual and cultural activities, as they are not experiencing joy or a sense of belonging in their pursuits."

"Consider this post: ""Every single moment of my life lately has been absolute torture, and filled with mental anguish. There is not many things i'd rather do at the moment besides kill myself.

My father and I have a special bond that you don't find with many people nowadays; we aren't just family, we are best friends. My father is the only person I can really speak my mind to, and he has said that I am his only true friend. My father has been through some dark places lately, too. It feels like the universe won't let him keep anything good for too long. He's lost about 5 jobs over the past month, through no fault of his own. My mother and the love of his life said no to his marriage proposal and left him. His parents give him 0 encouragement for anything. I won't go into any more detail about him as I'm afraid he'll find this post by some luck, and the fact that I've been rambling.

Reasoning: In the post, the individual expresses frustration and dislike towards aspects of internet culture and popular media.

Question: Does the vocational wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: In this post, the author expresses feelings of hopelessness, wanting to escape, and contemplating suicide.

Today I got a text out of the blue saying She wants to meet in person this week to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù. Every part of me still wants to be with her and it kills me to think of a life without her; especially after going as far as planning our futures together. I thought the holidays were going to be the worst of it, but I‚Äôm slowly realizing that when everyone is getting back into their routines I‚Äôm still stuck. I want to get a job and go to school and be successful, but I feel trapped in this dark pit. I really don‚Äôt want to live anymore and the only thing keeping me from killing my self is the pain and disarray I would cause my Mom and Dad. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants daily; I have since I was 13. I don‚Äôt want to open myself up completely to my therapist because of my fears of being shipped to a mental health hospital. My parents in the past have seriously suggested that I stay in one.

"Consider this post: ""I feel really weird doing this. I'm not good at talking about this stuff. But I have a couple reasons to think unloading anonymously might help a little. I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about half my life, since I was in middle school. Had a couple close calls, but had my first genuine attempt last summer. I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today. I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived.

I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage. Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.""

Reasoning: The post primarily focuses on the individual's personal struggles with college, depression, and the financial implications of failing.

"Consider this post: ""I was recently diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, OCD, and depression. I met with a on-campus counselor and after several sessions I was referred to a psychiatrist, and after several meetings with him and with other professionals I was finally diagnosed (took almost a year). The fucking issue is I can't get help at all, all of the psychiatry work was done at a near by mental hospital. And the counseling was done on campus, I was referred to several therapists/psychologists/specialists/etc to continue work but I don't have a car and counseling on campus is very limited in the amount of sessions you can do (10 per 2 semesters/or per issue). So I'm fucked because I can't afford any of my medications because I'm a poor American and thus don't have healthcare and can't afford medication, I don't have a car and there a no therapists near by me that I can walk to or ride the bus too."" Question: Does the spiritual wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: In the post, the individual discusses their mental health diagnoses and the challenges they face in accessing treatment due to financial constraints and lack of transportation. While their situation is certainly distressing, there is no explicit mention of a search for meaning or purpose in human existence. The focus is primarily on the practical barriers they encounter in receiving the necessary healthcare and resources. Therefore, the post does not reflect the wellness dimension of the spiritual aspect as defined by Dunn's model."

"Consider this post: ""2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise.

Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late.

This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. I feel like I need help, but I don't want to jeopardize everything like I did with my ex by exposing my insecurities. I feel that exposing my sadness would repel everyone around me. I feel my problems are too silly. Heck, I've been putting off this post for months now and I stopped halfway my stream of conciousness because there are far more serious problems to discuss about here than some indecision, burn-out and post-breakup trauma.

That is not to say that they are a bad person. It is just that sometimes things get hectic and it is hard to see all of the little thing that somebody does for you to make your life easier.

Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didn‚Äôt tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. We‚Äôre now working adults now and well, we drifted apart. I‚Äôm at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that I‚Äôm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I don‚Äôt think thats possible.

"Consider this post: ""For half a year now I'm fighting a fight I can't seem to win. It's like I never even turned 19 this summer. I started university this fall and got together with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She was so supportive and caring that she was afraid to speak about her own problems. She broke up with me because of that a week ago. I made her feel worse, it's my fault she broke up with me. The whole second half of 2016 is a blur. Since I've been diagnosed with severe depression in August I tried medication and am currently in therapy. It kinda helps but over the past week I thought a lot. I don't think I can do this.

The break-up, depression, moving out, having no close friends at my university, no sure if I even want to study the subjects I'm studying. I don't know where to begin; where to start fixing this mess I made. I fucked up. I'm not sure what to do when I'm alone in my flat tomorrow evening. I don't even want to think about that situation.

"Consider this post: ""As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would. Thank you for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated. -A"" Question: Does the emotional wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post.

"Consider this post: ""In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on. At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months.

I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided. But I know that depressions don't go away with time, and that's what I'm worried about. So was I suffering from clinical depression in 2014? Or was it just circumstantial thing?"" Question: Does the spiritual wellness dimension exist in the post?","No, this wellness dimension does not exist in the post. Reasoning: In the post, the individual describes experiencing an identity crisis and asking fundamental questions about life and death. They also mention wanting to harm themselves and others. These thoughts and feelings indicate a deep existential struggle and a search for meaning and purpose in their existence.

Question: Does the intellectual wellness dimension exist in the post?","Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post. Reasoning: In the post, the individual mentions their past therapy for anxiety, depression, and PTSD, indicating a focus on their mental health and well-being. They also express a desire to be a better person and mention their struggles with social interaction. This suggests an awareness and effort towards personal growth and intellectual development in order to improve their psychological wellness. However, towards the end of the post, they mention the possibility of shutting the world out and existing in solitude, which could indicate a potential lack of balance in their intellectual aspect of wellness."

Question: Does the social wellness dimension exist in the post?","Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post. Reasoning: The post discusses the individual's struggle with therapy and their desire to shut out the world and exist in solitude. This indicates a lack of interdependence between the individual and society, as they are questioning the possibility of finding happiness without any social connections. This lack of social interdependence aligns with the absence of the social dimension of wellness in Dunn's model."

"Consider this post: ""Hey ya'll. Happy New Year! I want to recover from depression, but have an odd conundrum. I've been depressed all of my adult life and I worry if I get better from this, what if I do not like the new version of myself? I guess I don't know what part of my personality is a mental illness and what part is actually who I am, and so if I tame the mental illness then what if I don't like the version of me that's left? Has anyone felt like this, and if so how did you approach the recovery process? I cannot afford medication or therapy so I am in the process of making my own plan of action to help me out until I can find a therapist on a sliding scale (the waiting lists are a bitch where I live for this sort of thing).

While they mention their general ill feelings and past experience with therapy for depression symptoms, there is no explicit mention of engaging in intellectual or cultural activities. The focus of the post is primarily on the negative experience with the counselor and the individual's fear about supporting themselves in a new city."
"Consider this post: ""I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself. I haven‚Äôt been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms. Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, ‚Äúdid that even help if you stopped going?‚Äù He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school‚Äôs records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right now‚Äù I'm moving to a new city soon, so I really feel scared about how I'm going to support myself. As someone who's generally self-sufficient this was sort of a heavy blow, since I really need someone to talk to."" Question: Does the social wellness dimension exist in the post?","Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post. Reasoning: The post discusses the individual's experience with therapy and their feelings of being invalidated and misunderstood by the counselor. This indicates a reliance on the social aspect of wellness, as the individual seeks support and understanding from a professional. The individual also expresses fear about moving to a new city and the potential lack of support, further emphasizing their need for social connections and interdependence."

"Consider this post: ""I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise.

My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again.

This is the last thing I want. I love her to death I don't want to force her to accept any decision I make I just need help in trying to get her out of her depression. We've tried as a family to get her to go to the doctor but failed. She's always been creative and outgoing but since we talked about my decision, she's barley left the house, gained weight, and is in constant anger.

Reasoning: The wellness dimension of emotional aspect does not exist in the post.

"Consider this post: ""That's what I truly want, I want people to prove to me that they want me around, that they appreciate my time.

"Consider this post: ""Hi guys, Looking for any help I can get! I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.) I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember. I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked.

"Consider this post: ""Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far: I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. Sex drive has plummeted. Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness. I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post. I hate myself and genuinely don't want to die but I can't see any other options. I just want someone to love me"" Question: Does the intellectual wellness dimension exist in the post?","Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post.

"Consider this post: ""Hi, everyone. I thank you in advance for reading this post. I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me. I don't know what to do if I lose my job, I don't have close friends and my boyfriend is poor and still lives with his parents Any advice or opinion? I need help. Thank you. :)"" Question: Does the emotional wellness dimension exist in the post?","Yes, this wellness dimension exists in the post.
